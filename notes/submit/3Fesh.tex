\begin{abstract}
 In a Feshbach resonance, the effective s-wave scattering length grows when one tunes toward the resonance point, and eventually diverges at this point.  There is one characteristic energy scale, $\delta_c$, defined as, in the negative side of the resonance point, the detuning energy at which the weight of the bound state shifts from predominately in the open-channel to predominately in the closed-channel.  When the many-body energy scale (e.g. the Fermi energy, $E_{F}$) is larger than $\delta_c$, the closed-channel weight is significant and has to be included in the many-body theory.  Furthermore, when two channels share a hyperfine species, the Pauli exclusion between fermions from two channels also needs to be taken into consideration in the many-body theory.  
In the current report, a set of gap equations and number equations  are derived at the mean-field level.  The fermionic and bosonic excitation spectra are then also studied. Assuming that the uncoupled bound-state of the closed-channel in resonance is much smaller than the inter-particle distance and  the s-wave scattering length, we find that  the basic equations in the single-channel crossover model are still valid. The correction first comes from the existing of the finite chemical potential and additional counting complication due to the closed-channel.  These two corrections need to be included into the mean-field equations, i.e. the gap equations and the number equations, and to be solved self-consistently.  Then the correction due to the inter-channel Pauli exclusion is in the  order of the ratio of the Fermi energy and the Zeeman energy difference between two channels, $E_F/\eta$, which can be analyzed perturbatively over the previous corrections.

\section{Introduction}

In a low-temperature dilute system, a short-range interaction can be characterized with a single parameter, $a_s$, a.k.a. the s-wave scattering length.    A very desirable property of the Feshbach resonance in such a system is that the effective interaction is tunable experimentally through the Zeeman energy difference between channels which is in turn  tunable through  instruments such as a magnetic field  \cite{Fano,nuclear,ChinRMP,Pethick}. 
 \begin{equation}
a_{s}(B)=a_{bg}\br{1+\frac{\Delta{B}}{B-B_{0}}}
\end{equation}
where $B_{0}$ is the magnetic field at which the $a_{s}$ diverges, i.e., the  resonant point. 
This unique ability gives physicists a rare opportunity to study  a many-body system under various interaction strengths,  and thus connect different physics originally developed separately.  Particularly for the fermionic gas, there are a series of  theoretical works about uniform treatment of  BEC and BCS since the 1960s \cite{Eagle,LeggettCrossover,Nozieres,RanderiaBEC}, for which dilute ultracold fermionic alkali gas with  Feshbach resonances provides a perfect testing ground.  Indeed,  these theories work quite well  qualitatively.  

%One important characteristic quantity of Feshbach resonance is $\delta_{C}$N (see detail in Chapter \ref{sec:intro:twobody} for details): when detuning from resonance is smaller than it, open-channel atoms dominate and closed-channel can be neglected.  The effective interaction can still be characterized by $a_{s}$.  One seems to acquire a ``magic knob'' that can tune the interaction between atoms.  On the other hand, when negative tuning is much larger than $\delta_{C}$, atoms in closed-channel have comparable weight to that of open-channel or even dominate them.  Two channels need to be considered at the same time.  


%This report tries to look into the idiosyncrasy of the Feshbach resonance in contrast with a true ``Simple'' knob of the interaction strength.

\parbox{0.9\columnwidth}{\raggedright \small $\delta$ is the energy detuning from the resonance point.  The horizontal line stands for the zero energy s-wave scattering state, $\psi\sim\nth{r}-\nth{a_s}$, which exists for any detuning.  The lower line stands for the real bound state, which only exists for negative detuning ($\delta<0$, $a_s>0$). The dash line stands for the (uncoupled) closed-channel bound state.  An interesting point to notice is that the real bound state appears earlier than the cross point of the (uncoupled) closed-channel bound state level and zero energy. Another important point to notice is the negative detuning $-\delta_c$.  When the negative detuning is smaller than $\delta_c$, this real bound state is composed mostly with atoms in the open-channel and vice verse.  %See Section \ref{sec:model} for details about $\mathcal{K}$ and $\delta_c$.

\end{figure}

  The two-body theory of the Feshbach resonance has a characteristic  parameter, $\delta_c\sim{}a_{bg}^2(\Delta{B})^2$, defined as  the detuning energy at which the weight of the bound state shifts from predominatly in the open-channel to predominatly in the closed-channel (see Fig. \ref{fig:intro:levels}) \cite{Leggett}.  Na\"{i}vely speaking, in the negative detuning side of any resonance (i.e. $\delta<0$), particles should mostly stay  in a (virtual) bound-state of the closed-channel (or ``virtual state'' in some other-type resonances).  However, at the resonance point  of a Feshbach resonance ($a_s\to\pm\infty$), atoms are mostly still in the open-channel, and they do so down to a negative detuning $\delta\sim-\delta_c$. Only when the detuning from resonance is much larger than $\delta_c$, do atoms have the majority weight in the closed-channel.    
  
  When considering a many-body system with a Feshbach resonance, an important question is how this energy scale, $\delta_c$, compares to a typical many-body energy scale, namely, the Fermi energy of the free fermionic atoms. In the region not too far away from the resonance ($\abs{\delta}\ll\delta_{c}$), the closed-channel weight is negligible if the Fermi energy is much smaller than $\delta_c$, (i.e., \emph{broad resonance}).  Crossover experiments are usually performed at detuning not too far from the resonance, and hence the closed-channel can be safely ignored at the many-body level. Eventually, when the detuning is too far away, $\abs{\delta}\gg\delta_{c}$, the bound state is almost like the    uncoupled closed-channel bound state with a little dressing from the open-channel.  We nevertheless do not concern such situations for the broad resonance because crossover phenomena have already be well covered in both BEC and BCS ends with $\abs{\delta}\ll\delta_{c}$. Within the above consideration, the problem can be well-described as a two-species fermion system with a tunable interaction.  The Feshbach resonance indeed serves as a simple ``magic'' knob to change the interaction strength.  The original  theories developed on  single-channel models  apply to this case directly.  This is also the situation for two  popular experiment cases (${}^{6}\text{Li}$ atoms at 834G, $^{40}\text{K}$ atoms at 224G).   Many theoretical works have been developed using the single-channel model or using the tow-channel model with the broad resonance assumption (e.g. \cite{Holland01,HoUniversal,Fuchs04}). On the contrary, when the Fermi energy of the free fermionic atoms is  comparable to or even larger than $\delta_c$, the closed-channel has to be included at the many-body level even for small detuning. Such a situation, previously considered in some works \cite{GurarieNarrow}, is the focus of the current work.
  
  %Nevertheless, one crucial simplification comes from  the fact  that relevant uncoupled closed-channel bound state is  tightly bound, with spatial extension much smaller than  many-body scales, e.g. the interparticle distance, (but often larger than the potential range).  This fact enable us to treat the Pauli exclusion between two channels perturbatively. It is not necessary to handle all the  fermion species simultaneously, which probably requires quite different techniques  other than those discussed in this report. 

To complicate the problem even further,   configurations of Feshbach resonances often have one common hyperfine species between the two channels. There are three hyperfine species in the  two channels instead of four species (two for each channel).  Two most common setups (${}^{6}\text{Li}$ at 834G, $^{40}\text{K}$ at 224G) both contain three species of fermions although they are broad resonances.  The Pauli exclusion principle prevents  atoms of both channels from occupying the same momentum level simultaneously because of this common species.  The inter-channel Pauli exclusion has no counterpart in two-body physics. This peculiar effect  in many-body crossover problems has  received little theoretical attention up to now.    Nevertheless,   narrow resonances do exist \cite{ChinRMP} and it is not  inconceivable to perform many-body experiments using such resonances.  The central concern of this report is about these situations. 

Roughly speaking, turning from two-body systems to many-body systems brings three new effects into the original two-body problem.  The first effect is closely associated with the Fermi energy:  For a many-body fermionic system at low temperature, most fermions are inactive; only the fermions close to the Fermi surface participate in the interaction processes. Therefore, energy often needs to be measured from the Fermi surface instead of from zero as in a two-body situation. 
The second effect is about counting. Unlike in the single-channel problem, there are two relevant densities in the two-channel problem: the density of atoms in the open-channel, $n_{o}$, and the density of atoms in the closed-channel, $n_{c}$. When the closed-channel weight is small (broad resonance), it is all right to treat the total density as the same as the open-channel density.  However, in the narrow resonance, where the closed-channel weight is not negligible, counting becomes complicated.  Extra care is required to specify which channel the  quantities, such as ``density'', belong to.  These two aspects have been   extensively studied previously \cite{GurarieNarrow}.

The last effect is unique for the three-species problem, where one common species is shared by both channels.  The phase spaces of two channels are overlapped because of  the common species, which prevents both channels have the occupation in the same momentum level simutaneously. This effect is controlled by the wave-function overlapping of the states in the two channels. A rough estimate of this overlapping can be made: The uncoupled closed-channel bound-state which is in resonance with the open-channel zero energy threshold has  relatively small  spatial extension, $a_c$.  Its binding energy $E_b$ is close to the Zeeman energy difference between two channels, $\eta$.  On the other hand, fermions in the open-channel fill the lowest  momentum states up to typically the Fermi energy, $E_F$.  By a simple dimensional argument, the ratio $E_F/\eta$ must control the overlapping effect. This effect has  not been addressed in any theoretical work to this author's knowledge.  How it modifies the many-body picture is the central topic of this report. 

%We can see this from a slightly alternative aspect using two-fermion molecule gas for the uncoupled closed-channel bound state. We assume that the molecule size is $a_{c}$ and the total number of molecules is $N$.  Assuming further that the bound-state is close to threshold,   the bound-state wave function can then be written as $A/(k^{2}+\kappa^{2})$, where $\hbar^{2}\kappa^{2}/2m=E_{b}$, (see Appendix \ref{sec:pathInt2:short-range}). The prefactor ``$A$'' can be determined  by normalization, $\sum_{k=0}^{1/a_{c}}\abs{\psi}^{2}\sim{}N$. Now  we consider all atoms in a typical many-body scale, e.g. the Fermi energy, $E_{F}$, which is going to overlap with levels occupied in the open-channel. Usually, the Fermi energy is much smaller than the energy scale of the closed-channel bound state, $E_{F}\ll{}E_b$.  The total number of atoms in $[0,E_F]$ is roughly $N\cdot(k_{F}a_{c})^{3}$, which is much smaller than $N$. This means that in the two-channel problem, the low momenta,  ($k\lesssim{}k_F$), are still dominated by the open-channel component even when the total number of atoms in the closed-channel is comparable or higher than the total number  of atoms in the open-channel because atoms in the closed-channel are mostly in  high-momentum states.     

The present report is divided as follows:
Section \ref{sec:model}  defines the many-body model and introduces the two-component order parameters. Section \ref{sec:mean} lists the mean-field results and its renormalization. Section \ref{sec:excitation} lists the results for the fermionic and bosonic excitation. We conclude and discuss our approach in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.  
We do not list all the calculation in this report due to the limited length. Please refer to G. Z.'s dissertation \cite{Zhuthesis} for calculation details. 
%More specifically, Chapter \ref{sec:intro:one} briefly reviews  dilute ultracold alkali gas.   Section \ref{sec:intro:as} in particular examines the idea of ``universality'', which is one of the central ideas in our treatment of the two-channel model.  Chapter \ref{sec:intro:twobody} goes over the Feshbach resonance in two-body physics and  the concept of  the narrow (broad) resonance is introduced. Chapter \ref{sec:intro:1channel} reviews the single-channel BEC-BCS crossover problem as well as the path-integral approach solving it. This chapter serves as the starting point for the solution of the two-channel model. After these reviews,   Chapter \ref{ch:path2} and Chapter \ref{ch:excitation} present my work on the three-species narrow Feshbach resonance within a many-body path-integral framework, in detail.   Chapter \ref{ch:path2} discusses the mean field result while Chapter \ref{ch:excitation} discusses fermionic and bosonic excitations. An earlier attempt   based on the BCS ansatz  approach in mean-field level is given in Appendix \ref{ch:mean}.  Chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} discusses our procedures and their conclusions.  

\section{Model and order parameters\label{sec:model}}
We denote the three hyperfine species as $a$, $b$ and $c$, where $(a, b)$  consists the open-channel and $(a,c)$ consists the closed-channel.  Introduce the vector form of the two channels.   
\begin{equation}
(\bar\psi\bar\psi)=\mtrx{\bar\psi_{a}\bar\psi_{b}&\bar\psi_{a}\bar\psi_{c}}
\qquad(\psi\psi)=\mtrx{\psi_{b}\psi_{a}\\\psi_{c}\psi_{a}}
\end{equation}
The two-body interaction can then be written as a ($2\times2$)  hermitian  matrix  $\tilde{U}$ 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{U}\equiv{}\mtrx{U&Y\\Y^{*}&V}
\end{equation}
We can now write the finite-temperature action as 
\begin{multline}\label{eq:pathInt2:actionFermi}
S(\bar\psi,\psi)=\int^{\beta}_{0}d\tau\int{d^{d}r}\\
\mbr{\sum_{j}\bar\psi_{j}(\partial_\tau-\nth{2m}\nabla^{2}-\mu+\eta_{j})\psi_{j}
-(\bar\psi\bar\psi)\tilde{U}(\psi\psi)}
\end{multline}
Here $\eta_{i}$ is the Zeeman energy for each hyperfine species. Assume $\eta_{a}=\eta_{b}=0$, $\eta_{c}=\eta$.  We  perform the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation here.   Introduce 2-component  auxiliary fields (order parameters), $(\Delta_{1},\Delta_{2})$, coupled to the fermionic fields as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pathInt2:DeltaPhi}
\Delta\longrightarrow\Delta-\tilde{U}(\psi\psi)
\end{equation}
%We can derive the action of $\psi$ and $\Delta$
%\begin{multline}\label{eq:pathInt2:actionMix}
%S_{\tau}(\bar\Delta,\Delta,\bar\psi_{i},\psi_{i})=\int^{\beta}_{0}d\tau\int{d^{d}r}\\
%\Big\{\sum_{j}\bar\psi_{j}(\partial_\tau-\nth{2m}\nabla^{2}-\mu+\eta_{j})\psi_{j}\\
%+[\Delta^{\dg}\tilde{U}^{-1}\Delta-(\bar\psi\bar\psi)\Delta-\bar\Delta{}(\psi\psi)]\Big\}
%\end{multline}
We can introduce  a spinor representation   $\bar\Psi=\mtrx{\bar\psi_{a}&\psi_{b}&\psi_{c}}$, $\Psi=\mtrx{\psi_{a}&\bar\psi_{b}&\bar\psi_{c}}^{T}$.
The action can then be rewritten in a more compact form with respect to $\Psi$ and $\bar\Psi$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pathInt2:actionMixCompact}
S(\bar\Delta,\Delta,\bar\psi_{i},\psi_{i})=\int^{\beta}_{0}d\tau\int{d^{d}r}
	\mbr{\Delta^{\dg}\tilde{U}^{-1}\Delta-\bar\Psi\mathcal{G}^{-1}\Psi}
\end{equation}
where the fermionic correlation $\mathcal{G}^{-1}$ in the momentum-frequency representation is 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nG}
\mathcal{G}^{-1}=
\begin{pmatrix}
i\omega_{n}-\xi_{k}&\Delta_{1}&\Delta_{2}\\
\bar\Delta_{1}&i\omega_{n}+\xi_{k}&0\\
\bar\Delta_{2}&0&i\omega_{n}+\xi_{k}+\eta
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The action in Eq. \ref{eq:pathInt2:actionMixCompact} is  bilinear to $\Psi$ ($\bar\Psi$) and we can integrate them out formally
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pathInt2:actionD}
S(\bar{\Delta},\Delta)=\int{dx}\br{\bar{\Delta}\tilde{U}^{-1}\Delta-\tr\ln\nG}
\end{equation}
%Note that at this stage $\Delta(\mathbf{r},\tau)$  is not necessarily homogeneous in space or pseudo-time as in the mean-field result.  


\section{Mean-field result and renormalization\label{sec:mean}}
 Eq. (\ref{eq:nG}) can be inverted to get $G$.   The final mean-field equations are (For simplicity,  both $\Delta_{i}$'s are taken as real.\footnote{\label{foot:pathInt2:real}When $Y$ is not real, $\Delta_{1}$ and $\Delta_{2}$ cannot be both real even at the mean field level.  Nevertheless, we can require one  real, then the other will have a phase just to compensate the phase in $Y$.  The final conclusion can be verified  still valid.   }) 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:pathInt2:mf}
\mtrx{\Delta_1\\\Delta_2}=\mtrx{U&Y\\Y^{*}&V}\sum_{\vk}\mtrx{h_{1\vk}\\h_{2\vk}}
\end{equation}
  where 
  \begin{gather}
  h_{1\vk}=\av{\psi_{a,-{\vk}}\psi_{b,+{\vk}}}
  =\Delta_{1}\frac{E_{1\,\vk}+\xi_{\vk}+\eta}{(E_{1\,\vk}+E_{2\,\vk})(E_{1\,\vk}+E_{3\,\vk})}\label{eq:pathInt2:h1}\\
  h_{2\vk}=\av{\psi_{a,-{\vk}}\psi_{c,+{\vk}}}
  =\Delta_{2}\frac{E_{1\,\vk}+\xi_{\vk}}{(E_{1\,\vk}+E_{2\,\vk})(E_{1\,\vk}+E_{3\,\vk})}\label{eq:pathInt2:h2}
  \end{gather}
  
 The summation in the gap equations above (Eq. \ref{eq:pathInt2:mf}) diverges when being converted into integral at 3D because the artificial assumption of contact interactions.  We can nevertheless remove the singularity in two steps.  First, the closed-channel correlation $h_{2\vk}$ is projected to the two-body  bound-state wave function of the uncoupled closed-channel, $\phi_{0}$.  Second, the bare interaction in the open-channel is replaced with more physically meaningful quantity, the effective s-wave scattering length, $\tilde{a}_s$, which already incorporates the singularity. Please refer to G. Z.'s dissertation \cite{Zhuthesis} for the details of the calculation.  
 
    In  summary,  the effect of the inter-channel Pauli exclusion is controlled by the small parameter
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pathInt2:zetaDef}
\boxed{\zeta=\frac{\Delta_{2}^{2}}{\Delta_{1}\eta}\sim\br{\frac{E_{F}}{E_{b}}}^{1/2}\ll1}
\end{equation}
Where $E_{b}$ is the binding energy of the uncoupled closed-channel bound state. The order parameter for the closed-channel can be determined by the number equation of the closed-channel
\begin{equation}
N_{close}\approx\sum_{\vk}\frac{\Delta_{2}^2}{(\xi_{\vk}+\eta)(2\xi_{\vk}+\eta)}
\end{equation}
 Where $\xi_{\vk}=\hbar^{2}k^{2}/2m-\mu$ and $\eta$ is the energy difference between two channels. The renormalized gap equation is given as
 \begin{equation}
1=\frac{4\pi{\tilde{a}_{s}(\mu,\lambda_{1})}}{m}\sum(\nth{2E_{\vk}}-\nth{2\epsilon_{\vk}}-\frac{\Delta_{2}^{2}\xi_{\vk}}{4(\xi_{\vk}+\eta){E_{\vk}^{3}}})
	-\frac{\lambda_{2}}{\Delta_{1}}
\end{equation}
where $E_{\vk}=\sqrt{\xi_{\vk}^{2}+\Delta_{1}^{2}}$. Here, $\tilde{a}_{s}(\mu,\lambda_{1})$ is the two-body open-channel effective  s-wave scattering length with  an additional shifting $2\mu+\lambda_{1}$ as
\begin{equation}
{a}_{s}=a_{\text{bg}}(1+\frac{\mathcal{K}}{\delta-2\mu-\lambda_{1}})
\end{equation}
  $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{2}$ are two new parameters describing the overlapping of the two channels, and they can be calibrated from  experiments.  The open-channel number equation is
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
N_{open}\approx\sum_\vk\mbr{\frac{E_\vk-\xi_\vk}{2E_\vk}(1+\frac{\Delta_{1}}{\eta}\zeta)-\frac{\Delta_{1}^{3}}{4E_\vk^{3}}\zeta
	}	
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The open-channel number equation and the associated gap equation need to be solved self-consistently to get  the mean field result ($\Delta_{1}$ and $\mu$).  One of the most noteworthy new phenomena is probably that the open-channel gap $\Delta_{1}$ saturates in the BEC side of  a narrow resonance. 

  
  
  
  
\section{Excitation modes\label{sec:excitation}}
\subsection{Fermionic modes}
%We  can break down the unitary transformation into two steps $T$ and $L$. 
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:pathInt2:B}
%B_{\omega_{n},\vk}=L_k^{\dg}T_k^{\dg}G_{\omega_{n},\vk}^{-1}T_kL_k
%\end{equation} 
%Here $B_{k}$ is the diagonal matrix; $T$ and $L$ are both unitary transformation.  We take $T$ as the canonical transformation at the broad resonance, i.e., when we can ignore the inter-channel Pauli exclusion. 
%Introduce a dimensionless scale $\zeta$,
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:pathInt2:zetaDef}
%\boxed{\zeta=\frac{\Delta_{2}^{2}}{\Delta_{1}\eta}}
%\end{equation}
%Here both $\Delta_{1}$ and $\Delta_{2}$ are their mean-field (saddle point) values.  It can be verified that $\zeta\ll1$ (See Appendix \ref{sec:pathApp:consistency}).  
%This matrix can then be diagonalized with  the unitary transformation $L_{\vk}$ within the first order of $\zeta$  (see Appendix \ref{sec:diagonalize} for details of calculation.)
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:pathInt2:Bapprox}
%\begin{split}
%B_{\omega_{n},\vk}&=i\omega_{n}I-
%	\mtrx{E_{1}{}_{\vk}&0&0\\0&-E_{2}{}_{\vk}&0\\0&0&-E_{3}{}_{\vk}}\\
%%	&\approx{}i\omega_{n}I-
%%	\mtrx{E_{\vk}+{}u_{\vk}^{2}\zeta&0&0\\
%%	0&-\br{E_{\vk}-{}v_{\vk}^{2}\zeta}&0\\0&0&-\br{\xi_{\vk}+\eta-\frac{\zeta}{2}}}
%%	&=
%%	\mtrx{i\omega_{n}-E_{\vk}&0&0\\0&i\omega_{n}+E_{\vk}&0\\0&0&i\omega_{n}+\eta}
%%	+\mtrx{-\frac{D_{1}^{2}}{\eta}&0&0\\0&-\frac{D_{2}^{2}}{\eta}&0\\0&0&+\frac{D_{1}^{2}+D_{2}^{2}}{2\eta}}\\
%%	&\equiv{}B^{(0)}_{\vk}+B^{(1)}_{\vk}
%\end{split}	
%\end{equation}

The dispersion spectrum of fermions is
\begin{align}\label{eq:pathInt2:xiExpand}
E_{1\vk}&\approx{}E_{\vk}+\frac{\Delta_{2}^{2}u_{\vk}^{2}}{\xi_{\vk}+\eta}
\approx{}E_{\vk}+u_{\vk}^{2}\Delta_{1}\zeta\\
E_{2\vk}&\approx{}E_{\vk}-\frac{\Delta_{2}^{2}v_{\vk}^{2}}{\xi_{\vk}+\eta}
\approx{}E_{\vk}-v_{\vk}^{2}\Delta_{1}\zeta\label{eq:pathInt2:xiExpand2}\\
E_{3\vk}&\approx{}\xi_{\vk}+\eta-\frac{\Delta_{2}^{2}}{2(\xi_{\vk}+\eta)}
\approx{}\epsilon_{\vk}+\eta-\frac{\zeta}{2}\Delta_{1}
\label{eq:pathInt2:xiExpand3}
\end{align}
Here the $E_{1\vk}$ and $E_{2\vk}$ correspond the traditional Bogoliubov quasi-particle modes; while $E_{3\vk}$ describes the fermionic excitation to the closed-channel.  The correction due to the inter-channel Pauli exclusion are all in the order of $\zeta$.





\subsection{Collective modes}
Order parameters ($\Delta_{1}$, $\Delta_{2}$) are defined in terms of collective behaviors of many fermion atoms.  Fluctuations of order parameters thus marked the collective excitation modes of the system. Here with a two-component order parameter, four independent modes exist:   two for magnitude variation of each $\Delta_i$,  internal phase between two $\Delta_i$, and the overall local phase $\theta(x)$ of $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$.  The first three change the magnitude of action and therefore are massive; while the last one leaves the action invariant and thus is massless. 
We proceed to study two modes of the phase fluctuation.  

The in-sync phase mode is the counterpart of the Anderson-Bogoliubov modes in the single channel problem. The action $S(\bar{\Delta}_i,\Delta_i)$ (Eq. \ref{eq:pathInt2:actionD}), is invariant if the phases of $\Delta_{1\,\vk}$ and $\Delta_{2\,\vk}$ rotate simultaneously. We therefore conclude that there exists a massless (Goldstone) mode corresponding to the local phase invariance.  Introduce the phase fluctuation $\theta$, 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta_{i}(x)\rightarrow{}\Delta_{i}e^{i2\theta(x)}\qquad{}
\bar{\Delta}_{i}(x)\rightarrow{}\bar{\Delta}_{i}e^{-i2\theta(x)}
\end{equation*}
We have a new action for the phase fluctuation $\theta$
\begin{equation}
S[\theta]=\int{dx}\sum_{q}\theta(q)\theta(-q)\big[\nth{2}\pi^{(0)}(0)\omega_m^2-\frac{n}{2m}q^2\big]
\end{equation}
The fluctuation has a linear dispersion relationship and therefore is a sound-like mode.    It is not hard to show that the velocity follows the same structure as that for the single-channel crossover problem \cite{RanderiaBEC} with the correction in the order of $\zeta$.

The out-of-sync phase mode can be studied with the similar approach. However, for this mode, we can show that the action is 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pathInt2:outofphase}
S[\theta]=\int{dx}\sum_{q}\theta(q)\theta(-q)\big[\nth{4}\pi^{(0)}(0)(\omega_m^2-\omega_{0}^{2})-\frac{n}{4m}q^2\big]
\end{equation}
$\omega_{m}$ has a finite value $\omega_{0}$ at the zero momentum.  It can be shown that $\omega_{0}$
 is in the order of the ionization (pair breaking) energy.  

\section{Conclusion  and discussion\label{sec:conclusion}}
In this report, we study the narrow Feshbach resonance in  the three-species case where two channels share the same species.  

In general, for the narrow resonance without a shared species, the main correction to the single-channel result comes from the  extra counting of the atoms in the open-channel, which leads to the extra shift $2\mu$ in $\tilde{a}_{s}$, and the closed-channel, which leads to the extra number equation.  Two number equations exist, one for each channel.  The open-channel number equation resembles the number equation of the single-channel model.

When there is a common species,  however, the  Pauli exclusion between two channels due to the common species in the three-species narrow resonance, calls for careful  consideration.  Our treatment follows the spirit of the so-called ``universality'' idea\cite{Tan2008-1,shizhongUniv}.  For a dilute system with a short-range potential, such as the dilute ultracold alkali gas, the short-range part of a two-body correlation does not significantly change from two-body  to many-body.  This particular feature justifies using the two-body quantities (e.g. the s-wave scattering length $a_{s}$) as the boundary condition for the many-body correlations.  The most part of the correlations, where no two particles are close in short-range, is essentially free from interaction. This long-range part of the correlations does change from two-body to many-body.  Unique in our problem is the involvement of the Feshbach resonance.  A resonance makes the system extremely sensitive to even a small change in the relative weight between two channels. We use the fact that,  in the Feshbach resonance, the closed-channel bound state, $\phi_{0}$, as a short-range object,  is still not very sensitive to the resonance; hence, we can, within the universality idea,  apply a simple boundary condition to the closed-channel correlation. However, the indirect interaction mediated by the closed-channel dominates the direct interaction within the open-channel. Consequently, a small change in the closed-channel bound-state weight \emph{does} affect the short-range wave function in the open-channel, originally expressed through the boundary condition using the s-wave scattering length $a_{s}$. 

When the spatial extension of  the closed-channel bound state is  of the order of the   inter-particle distance, $a_{0}$, or even larger, the Feshbach resonance in the many-body context is a genuine three-species many-body problem and no simple solution is available.  By contrast, when the bound-state's spatial extension is much smaller than the interparticle distance, the ratio ($a_{c}/a_{0}$) serves as the expansion parameter and we can extract  the effect of the inter-channel Pauli exclusion perturbatively.  In essence, we can then  ignore the many-body effects within  closed-channel bound-states, while only taking into consideration  the Pauli exclusion between channels.  A few new parameters need to be introduced and can be calibrated from experiments, such as $\lambda_{1}$, $\lambda_{2}$.  Mean field properties can still be determined through gap equations and number equations similar as in the single-channel case.  The excitation modes are also close to the original single-channel result with correction of the order of $zeta$.
%We can distinguish three different regimes for the many-body energy scale $E_F$ when compared with the two-body physics.  
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item The regime where $E_F$ is much smaller than the characteristic energy $\delta_c$ (See Eq. \ref{eq:intro:deltaC} in Sec. \ref{sec:intro:twobody}). Around resonance, the closed-channel weight is negligible in this regime. We can then ignore the closed-channel completely and approximate the effective open-channel interaction by a  pseudo-potential characterized by the s-wave scattering length, $a_s$. 
%\item The regime where  $E_F$ is larger than $\delta_c$, but smaller than the closed-channel bound state binding energy $E_b$, or the bare detuning $\eta$.  The closed-channel weight is significant in this regime and cannot be ignored, which means $n_{\text{open}}+n_{\text{close}}=n_{\text{total}}$. Also, we need to take into account the fact that, in the resonance formula of $a_s$, shifting should be counted from the Fermi surface instead of from zero as in two-body physics.    These effects, considered previously\cite{GurarieNarrow}, are  also carefully analyzed in this thesis.  Furthermore, the Pauli exclusion between two channels needs to be taken into account when these two channels share a common species.  Nevertheless, at  low momentum, where the open-channel has most of its weight, the closed-channel bound state only has very small weight.  Consequently, we can still treat the Pauli exclusion between channels perturbatively using the expansion coefficient  $E_F/\eta$. 
%\item The regime where  $E_F$ is larger than the binding energy $E_b$ or the bare detuning $\eta$. We have a genuine three-species many-body problem. This regime can be achieved in two ways.  One way requires a very large $E_F$, which indicates a very dense system.  However, it would be hard to imagine that  the original dilute alkali gas model still applies in this case. Various approximations in the model would probably break down beforehand, such as the pseudo-potential approximation with $a_s$. The second way requires a very small $\eta$, which indicates a genuine three-species many-body problem.  This remains an open problem.

     In our approach, we take the broad resonance result (or the single-channel crossover) as our zeroth order solution, upon which the expansion is performed.  It is however known that the simple BCS-type pairing treatment is not adequate  to quantitatively describe the whole BEC-BCS crossover region.  Therefore the zeroth order solution used here can be improved through further theoretical development.  Nevertheless, we expect the perturbative approach used here to build the narrow resonance from the single-channel crossover result to be still valid then.  Once the zeroth order solution (for a broad resonance or a single channel BEC-BCS crossover model) is patched over with whatever advancement, the correction of the narrow resonance in such a parameter regime, can still be obtained with a procedure similar as the one in the current report.
