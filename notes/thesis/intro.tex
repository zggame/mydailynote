\chapter{Introduction}
%Superfluidity in many-body fermionic system is one of the most dramatic and fascinating topic in physics. It calls the attention and effort from generation of physicists.  The study is dominated with one particular fermions, electrons.  However, this system suffers from one difficulty as the interaction  in a particular system is usually fixed and cannot be tuned experimentally.  
From a simple methodological view, a physics system with as little parameters as possible and each parameter as tunable as possible would be very desirable for developing and  verifying a theory. One of such systems is dilute fermionic gas with Feshbach resonance.  Fermionic dilute alkali gas was cooled into degenerate region in 1999\cite{DeMarco1999} and superfluidity was observed at even lower temperature in 2003\cite{Regal2003}.  

Feshbach resonance is widely used in the ultracold alkali gas experiments as a way to tune interaction strength.  This unique ability gives physicists the rare opportunity to study  many-body system under various interaction strength, which connects different physics originally developed separately.  Particularly for the fermion system, there are a series of  theoretically works about uniform treatment over BEC and BCS since 1960s \cite{Eagle,LeggettCrossover,Nozieres,RanderiaBEC}, for which ultracold alkali gas with Feshbach resonance provides the perfect testing grounds.  Indeed,  the theory works quite well  qualitatively.  

This thesis tries to look into the idiosyncrasy of the Feshbach resonance in contrast with a true ``Simple'' knob of the interaction strength.  Two-body theory of Feshbach resonance has a characteristic  parameter $\delta_c$.  Generally speaking, in the negative detuning side of a normal resonance, atoms should mostly stay  in closed-channel.  However, at resonance point  of Feshbach resonance, open-channel still dominates, and it does so up to negative detuning of $\delta_c$. Only when detuning from resonance is much larger than $\delta_c$, atoms have the majority weight in closed-channel.    Moving to a many-body problem, an important question is how this energy scale compares to a typical many-body energy scale, Fermi energy.  If Fermi energy is much smaller than $\delta_c$, (i.e., \emph{broad resonance}), in the relevant region, which is always not too far away from resonance, closed-channel weight is negligible, and can be safely ignored at many-body level. The problem can be well-described as a two-species fermion system with tunable interaction, while Feshbach is indeed a simple knob for interaction strength.  On the contrary, when Fermi energy is  comparable to or even larger than $\delta_c$, closed-channel cannot be ignored in many-body level. A many-body theory must include both channels.  Nevertheless, one crucial simplification comes from  the assumption that closed-channel bound state is relatively tight-bound, and is much smaller than  many-body scales, such as inter-particle distance, (but often larger than potential range though).  Therefore, we do not need to handle the three (four) fermion species simultaneously, which probably requires quite different techniques to solve. Instead, two channels can still be treated in step. 

To complicate the problem even further,  real experiments system often has one common species between two channels.  Pauli exclusion prevents both species occupy the same level simultaneously.  This peculiar effect has no counterpart in two-body physics, and is  the central concern in this thesis. 

Roughly speaking, many-body brings three effects.  The first one closely associates with Fermi energy.  At low temperature, most fermions are inactive and only fermions close to Fermi surface participate in various interaction. Therefore, energy often needs to be measured from Fermi sea instead of zero as in two-body situation.  This effect has been extensively studied in \cite{GurarieNarrow}.

The second effect is about counting. Unlike single-channel problem, there are two densities in the two-channel problem. When closed-channel weight is small (broad resonance), it is all right to treat the total density as the same as open-channel density.  However, in the narrow resonance, where closed-channel weight is not negligible, the counting is complicated.  Extra care is required to specify which channel the  quantities, such as ``density'', is.  This effect has been  also extensively studied in \cite{GurarieNarrow}.

The last effect is unique for the three-species problem, where one common species shows in both channels.  Phase space of two channels are overlapped because of the Pauli exclusion due to the common species. This effect is controlled by overlapping of states in two channels. A rough estimation can be made.  closed-channel bound-state in resonance is relatively small, and its binding energy $E_b$ is close to absolute energy difference between two channels, $\eta$.  On the other hand, fermions in open-channel occupies the lowest states in the momentum space and therefore spread out in space.  Its typical energy scale is $E_F$.  Therefore ratio $E_F/\eta$ is expected to control the overlapping effect. How such factor modifies the many-body picture is the center topic of this thesis. 

Alternatively, we can make a rough estimation using two-fermion molecule gas. We assume the molecule size is $a_{c}$ and the total number is $N$.  If assuming further that the bound-state is close-to-threshold,   wave function can then be written as $A/(k^{2}+\kappa^{2})$, where $\hbar^{2}\kappa^{2}/2m=E_{b}$, (see Appendix \ref{sec:pathInt2:short-range}). $A$ can be obtained by normalization, $\sum_{k=0}^{1/a_{c}}\abs{\psi}^{2}\sim{}N$. Now  we consider only particles, the typical many-body scale of open-channel occupation, i.e. Fermi energy, $E_{F}$, much smaller than the energy scale of closed-channel bound state, $E_{F}\ll\kappa$.  The total particle in this range is roughly $N\cdot(k_{F}a_{c})^{3}$, which is much smaller than $N$. Put this into the perspective of two-channel problem, the low-momentum ($k\lesssim{}k_F$), is still dominated by open-channel component even when the total number of closed-channel is comparable or higher than the total number  of open-channel because closed-channel is mostly in high-momentum state.     

 We review several important concepts about ultra-cold alkali gas in Chapter \ref{sec:intro:one}.  Particularly, section \ref{sec:intro:as} examines the idea of ``universality'', which is one of the central ideas in our treatment of two-channel model.  Chapter \ref{sec:intro:twobody} briefly goes over the Feshbach resonance in two-body physics, where concept of  narrow (broad) resonance is introduced. Chapter \ref{sec:intro:1channel} reviews the single-channel BEC-BCS crossover problem and the path-integral approach to solve it, which serves as the starting point in the two-channel model. After these review, we study the narrow Feshbach resonance within a many-body path-integral framework  This work is presented in Chapter \ref{ch:path2}.   Appendix \ref{ch:mean} included our earlier attempt   using BCS ansatz  approach in mean-field level, and it is included as.  Chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} discusses and concludes our approach.  

\chapter{Dilute ultracold alkali gas}\label{sec:intro:one}
Dilute ultracold Alkali gas became experimentally realized since 90s.  Not long after the bosonic ones, fermionic Alkali gas was also available at or below its Fermi temperature.  Because of the ultra-low temperature (in the order of nK), and diluteness ($10^{12}\sim10^{15}\text{cm}^{-3}$), the system is mostly \emph{free} except when atoms are close.   This particular properties simplifies the theoretical analysis tremendously (see Sec. \ref{sec:intro:as} for detail).  In this section, we covers a few aspects that closely related to this thesis.     

\section{Single atom and hyperfine levels}
In experiments of ultracold alkali gas, magnetic field ($\mathbf{B}$) is the most common physical quantity to manipulate.  First we study a  single isolated atom.  For an alkali atom, there is only one electron in the outer shell, and rest electrons are in the filled inner shells.  The filled shell has no total magnetic moment, so only the outermost electron interact with magnetic field through electron spin, $\mathbf{S}$.  Furthermore, magnetic field also interacts with nuclear spin, $\mathbf{I}$.  The full hamiltonian is
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\label{eq:intro:1atom}
H_{spin}&=A \mathbf{I}\cdot\mathbf{S}-\mu_{e}\mathbf{B}\cdot\mathbf{S}-{\mu}_{n}\mathbf{B}\cdot\mathbf{I}\\
&=A \mathbf{I}\cdot\mathbf{S}-\mu_{e}{B}{S_{z}}-{\mu}_{n}{B}{I_{z}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The first term in both lines describes the hyperfine interaction, while the next two terms describe Zeeman energy of electrons and nuclei respectively. $\mu_{e}$ is electron magnetic moment, while $\mu_n$ is the nuclear magnetic moment.  In the second line, we take the direction of magnetic field as z-direction. This hamiltonian can be diagonalized with the help of total spin 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{S}+\mathbf{I}
\end{equation}
When magnetic field is zero, $(F,F_{z})$ are good quantum numbers. Furthermore, all states with the same total spin $F$ are degenerated.   When magnetic field is finite, they are no longer good quantum numbers, nevertheless, we can still label states with these two numbers via their adiabatic connection to zero magnetic field.  For finite magnetic field, besides states with the highest and lowest $F_{z}=\pm{}F$, each state is a mix of different $(S_{z}, I_{z})$ or $(F,F_z)$.  Fortunately, $S=1/2$ for alkali gas,  so each state is mixed with maximum of two sets $(S_{z}, I_{z})$. At high magnetic field, the first hyperfine coupling term in Eq. \eqref{eq:intro:1atom} is dominated by the last two terms and  eigenstates are approximately described by quantum number $(S_{z},I_{z})$.  (Please refer to Fig. \ref{fig:intro:li6}.)

\section{Two-body interaction}
Things would be very boring if there was only single-atom hamiltonian.  Before we discuss the interaction itself, we introduce one important concept related to  interaction.   The basic unit with interaction is a pair of atoms.  A ``channel'' is used to refer one particular configuration of hyperfine spins for a pair, $\ket{F^{(1)},F_{z}^{(1)}}\otimes\ket{F^{(2)},F_{z}^{(2)}}$  \footnote{Remember that $(F,F_{z})$ are only label, and do not stand for total angular momentum unless no magnetic field.\label{foot:intro:f}}    Channels are good basis for non-interaction pair.  A pair of atom in one channel would stay in it forever if no interaction within it.  Now let us get back to alkali atoms.  Two alkali atoms interact mostly through the overlapping of their electron clouds in the dilute setup.  Thus besides atom-atom distance, the interaction is mostly function of electron spins only, with little-to-none dependence on nuclear spin.  Schematically the interaction can be written as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro:two}
V=f(r)+g(r)\mathbf{S_{1}}\cdot\mathbf{S_{2}}
\end{equation}
The hyperfine levels that diagonalize the single atom hamiltonian is no longer eigenstates for this interaction.  In another word, the interaction has non-diagonal term over channels and therefore hybridizes them. Instead, states with definite electron spins are good basis for two-atom interaction.  Most experiments is in the so-called high-field region where electron spin $S_z$ is approximately good quantum number, and therefore the original hyperfine levels (channels) serve as an good starting point as the zeroth order.  When the hybridization is considered, multichannel scattering is possible.  The most interesting thing in multi-channel scattering is resonance.  One of them is Feshbach resonance.  Potential in one channel may be deep enough to sustain a bound-state. When this bound-state energy is close to zero-energy threshold in the other channel, low-energy scattering properties in that channel is dramatically modified.  This resonance turns out extremely useful in   cold atoms experiments.  Chapter \ref{sec:intro:twobody} reviews its theory in  two-body physics; the more involving many-body problem is then the central theme of this thesis. 

In popular experiments setup for $^{6}$Li (Fig. \ref{fig:intro:li6}), usually experiments are prepared with atoms in two lowest hyperfine levels, described by simple direct product, $\ket{F=\nth{2},F_{z}=-\nth{2}}\otimes\ket{F=\nth{2},F_{z}=+\nth{2}}$.  This is a good approximation until when two atoms are very close.  Recall that the two-atom interaction (Eq. \ref{eq:intro:two}) conserves the z-component of total angular momentum, $F_{z}^{(1)}+F_{z}^{(2)}$.  Therefore this states mixed with four other possible channels, $\ket{\nth{2},-\nth{2}}\otimes\ket{\frac{3}{2},+\nth{2}}$, $\ket{\frac{3}{2},-\nth{2}}\otimes\ket{\nth{2},+\nth{2}}$, $\ket{\frac{3}{2},+\frac{3}{2}}\otimes\ket{\frac{3}{2},-\frac{3}{2}}$, $\ket{\frac{3}{2},+\frac{1}{2}}\otimes\ket{\frac{3}{2},-\frac{1}{2}}$ (All states is labeled as $\ket{F,F_{z}}$).  There are plenty of chances for resonance, and indeed, there are several of them.  Note that close to the resonance, it is normally sufficient to consider only the one channel that is in resonance, while neglect all others.  Another important aspect is whether the two channels share one single hyperfine levels (three species) or not (four species).   Indeed the closed channel in the most studied resonance close 834G is approximately $\ket{\frac{3}{2},-\nth{2}}\otimes\ket{\nth{2},+\nth{2}}$ and the resonance is a three-species one\cite{ZhangThesis,ChengRMP}. 

\section{Universality,  Bethe-Peierls boundary condition, s-wave scattering length, two-body density matrix\label{sec:intro:as}}
Another important aspect of interaction In dilute ultracold alkali gas is that the interaction can often be characterized by a single two-body parameter, s-wave scattering length, $a_s$,  when studying many problems, because  both the density and temperature are so low .  Often this is  interpreted as we can replace the real potential as a pseudo potential\cite{pethick}.  Nevertheless, an alternative interpretation about $a_s$ is more useful in this work\cite{LeggettBEC, Tan2008-1,Tan2008-2,CombescotTan}.  For short-range potential, where potential range $r_c$ is much smaller than average inter-particle distance $a_0$, it is not hard to see in the majority of the time, particles are free-like.  They only interact  when two particles are close to each other.  We can schematically divide the Hilbert space into two regions: $\mathcal{D}$, where any two particles are more than $a_c$ away from each other; and otherwise, $\mathcal{I}$ .  In the very dilute case, most physical quantities can be calculated only considering the free part, $\mathcal{D}$.  The effect of the potential on wave-function in the short-range region, $\mathcal{I}$, is to enforce the boundary condition on free part $\mathcal{D}$, $\psi(r)\xrightarrow{r\to0}\psi_{0}(r)$.  For an isometric $\psi_{0}(r)$, the lowest order in radial coordinator $r$ is $\nth{r}$.   Including the next order, a constant,  we have $\psi_{0}(r)=\nth{r}(1-\frac{r}{a_{s}})$ barring the normalization.  All these consideration gives us the simplest non-trivial boundary condition
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro:Bethe}
\psi(r)\xrightarrow{r\to0}\nth{r}-\nth{a_s}
\end{equation}
which is also known as Bethe-Peierls boundary condition\cite{BethePeierls}.  Because of the diluteness, in the interacting region, $\mathcal{I}$, we only need to consider the two-body interaction.  Therefore, we can determine $a_{s}$ through two-body physics.  And   this simple boundary condition applies to two-body, few-body, as well as many-body context, and proves to be a very powerful tool to various problems.  

Eq. \ref{eq:intro:Bethe} coincides the zero-energy s-wave scattering wave function, which explains the name of parameter ``$a_s$'', s-wave scattering length. Nevertheless,   note we did not mention anything about zero energy, where $a_{s}$ is defined in scattering theory context.  In fact,  this boundary condition applies generally to  any weak (positive or negative) energy solution as long as the energy involved is much lower than the energy scale in interaction region $\mathcal{I}$.  Therefore it can be easily  applied  to close-to-threshold bound state.  The s-wave wave function of a weak bound-state is $\psi(r)=\nth{r}e^{-r/a_s}$ in $\mathcal{D}$,\footnote{The extra $\nth{r}$ factor is there for  radial wave function in 3D.} which matches Bethe-Peierls boundary condition with a positive $a_{s}$ (for  $r\ll{}a_{s}$), and we have the often cited relation for binding energy $E_{b}$.
\begin{equation}
 E_{b}=\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{r}a_{s}^{2}}
\end{equation}
Here $m_{r}$ is the reduced mass for center of mass, which is equal to half of the atom mass for a pair of the same atoms.  This immediately clears one often confusing and counter-intuitive fact, that positive  $a_s$ corresponds to bound state.  If interpreting in the normal scattering theory, positive $a_s$  usually associates with the repulsive interaction, which obviously does not support a bound state.\footnote{This seemingly paradox can be resolved carefully within scattering theory as following. In scattering theory, the fact,  repulsive interaction leads to positive phase shift and therefore positive $a_s$, and attractive interaction leads to negative phase shift and negative $a_s$, is only true when interaction is weak, phase shift and $a_s$ is small.  At the strong interaction, where bound state is formed, phase shift changes $2\pi$; $a_s$ is large and  change sign over the threshold. }

 S-wave scattering length, $a_s$, or Eq. \ref{eq:intro:Bethe}, does not fix the normalization on the wave function. This normalization factor, turns out to be very useful.  In a dilute and low-energy system, the full system, its square is proportional to  \emph{integrated contact intensity}, $C$, defined in \cite{ Tan2008-1,Tan2008-2,CombescotTan}, besides a simple constant factor and total density.  At the limit where $a_c\to0$, $C$ and $a_s$ alone, can describe several important physical quantities, (for example internal energy).  A particular useful one for this thesis is the limit at high-momentum distribution of particles, 
 \begin{equation}
 n_k=\frac{C}{k^4}
 \end{equation}
 Note that here \emph{high-momentum} does not mean the absolutely high-momentum, it means lower than the characteristic momentum of potential $1/r_c$, but higher than any other scale, $1/a_0$,...  
 Indeed, when the short-range approximation and low-energy approximation apply, we expect that two-body correlation at  high-momentum ($\gg{k_{F}}$) does not change much from two-body system, few-body system to many-body system.  In this region, we can always use   two-body wave function as good approximation. 
 
 In many-body physics, lots of physical observable quantities relate to one set of  quantities, density matrix, $\av{\Psi^\dg\Psi^\dg\cdots\Psi\Psi}$. In fermionic system,  one-body density matrix is often very close to the free case, although the difference can be important for various theories (such as Landau Fermi liquid theory).  Two-body density matrix is often more use with more strikingly qualitative change, especially for phenomenon involving pairing. Formally, we can decompose it into orthogonal basis
 \begin{equation}
 \av{\Psi^\dg(x_1)\Psi^\dg(x_2)\Psi(y_2)\Psi(y_1)}=\sum_nC_n\phi_n^\dg(x_1,x_2)\phi_n(y_1,y_2)
 \end{equation}     
 When one or a few $C_n$ is macroscopic, the system behaves quantum mechanically in macroscopic term.  Especially when only one term is macroscopic, system can often be interpreted as one macroscopic wave function.\cite{Leggett}  This can serves as the starting point for several phenomenon, such as BEC, BCS superconductor,...
 
Zhang and Leggett developed independently another universality theory based on two-body density matrix \linebreak[2] \cite{shizhongUniv}, which actually takes a more general case.   They asserted that for short-range potential and low temperature, for example dilute ultracold alkali gas, the basis wave functions $\phi_n$ follows the two-body wave function at short-range. This is actually similar as Bethe-Peierls boundary condition Eq. \ref{eq:intro:Bethe}.  Instead of require the simplest form of $\psi_0$ in Eq. \eqref{eq:intro:Bethe}, they requires a more general wave-function that solves the  hamiltonian in two-body level.  And not surprisingly, many physical properties are determined by the normalization factors in boundary condition.  

In this thesis, similar idea is used along this line.  However, open-channel does not follow its two-body short-range wave-function because sensitive nature of resonance. 
 
 
 \chapter{Two-body Feshbach resonance\label{sec:intro:twobody}}
 As we discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:intro:as}, two-particle interaction is often approximated by a pseudo-potential characterized with s-wave scattering length $a_{s}$ in a dilute system.   The drastic  change  of $a_{s}$  via tuning energy difference (magnetic field) between two channels in Feshbach resonance gives  experimentalists the rare ability to tune the interaction strength between two particles.  And it is extremely useful in the study of BEC-BCS crossover where the interaction varies from weak to strong.  
 
Here we briefly review the Feshbach resonance in two-body system.   As discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:intro:one}, for isolated single atom, hyperfine level is the eigenstate.  However, when two atoms interacts, most of interaction comes from interaction of electrons while nucleons interacts very little.  Therefore, hyperfine levels is no longer true eigenstates of the two-body system and two hyperfine.  Nevertheless, hyperfine level serves a good approximated quantum number and levels are still labelled with it. Furthermore, we take ``channels'' as pair of hyperfine indices, they are in general different in interaction strength and are decoupled in the lowest order.  In magnetic field, different channels differ in energy mostly due to the Zeeman energy of electronic spin as electronic magnetic moment is much larger than nuclear magnetic moment.  This energy difference is easy to tune via magnetic field.  

When mixture between channels are taken into consideration, the simple single-channel scattering becomes multi-channel scattering.  Especially, when the one channel's threshold is close to a bound-state in the other channel when considered isolated, the scattering property in this channel is dramatically altered,  phase shift can changes $2\pi$ and s-wave scattering length $a_{s}$ changes to infinity and jumps to the infinity in opposite sign.  This is essentially what happens in Feshbach resonance, which was studied by Fano\cite{Fano} and Feshbach \cite{nuclear}  in nuclear and atom physics in 1960s.  Here we  mostly follow treatment in \cite{Leggett} (with some different symbols to comply with the rest of this thesis). 
\footnote{In order to conform with other parts of the thesis, this thesis uses some different symbols comparing to the original works by Leggett \cite{Leggett}.  Here I list them, with the symbols from \cite{Leggett} in parenthesis.  $U$ ($=-V$): open-channel interaction; $V$ ($=-V_{c}$): closed-channel interaction; $Y$ (=-$g\cdot{}f$): inter-channel coupling; $E_{b}$ ($=\epsilon_{0}$):binding energy of closed-channel bound state; $a_{c}$ ($=r_{0}$): range of potential; $\eta$ ($=\epsilon_0+\tilde\delta$) the Zeeman energy difference between two channels; $\mathcal{K}$ ($=\kappa$) see Eq.\ref{eq:intro:kappa}.}

The two-channel hamiltonian can be written as ($2\times2$ matrix for  (open,close) ``spinor'')
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro:ham}
\hat{H}(r)=
\begin{pmatrix}
-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{r}}\nabla^{2}-U(r)&\;&-Y(r)\\
-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{r}}\nabla^{2}+\eta-V(r)&\;&-Y(r)
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where energy zero is counted from that of the open channel at infinite separation. $\eta$ is the absolute difference in Zeeman energy of two channels.  All the interactions are short-range.  For a s-wave solution we have 
\begin{equation}
\psi(r)=\nth{r}\mtrx{\chi(r)\\\chi_{c}(r)}
\end{equation}
Now we can write down the time-independent \sch equation in radial direction:
\begin{align}
-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{r}}\chi''-U\chi-Y\chi_c&=E\chi\label{eq:intro:open}\\
-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{r}}\chi_c''+\eta\chi_c-V\chi_c-Y\chi&=E\chi_c\label{eq:intro:close}
\end{align}
We expand closed-channel wave function $\chi_{c}$ over the eigenstates of closed-channel hamiltonian, $\chi_{c}=\sum_{i}c_{i}\phi_{i}$, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro:sch2}
-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{r}}\phi_{i}''-V \phi_{i}=-E_{b}^{(i)}\phi_{i}
\end{equation}
Here we assume the energy difference between eigenstates are larger than other energy scale; hence coefficient $c_{0}$ of the  eigenstate in resonance,  $\phi_{0}$, dominates any other $c_{i}$'s.  $\chi_{c}\approx{}c_{0}\phi_{0}$.  Na\"{i}vely speaking, the resonance happens at the point where the closed-channel bound state level is exactly at the threshold of open-channel.  Therefore we introduce the relative detuning, $\tilde\delta=\eta-E_{b}$. Comparing Eq. \ref{eq:intro:open} and Eq. \ref{eq:intro:sch2}, it is not hard to find
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro:closeCoeff}
\chi_{c}=\frac{\phi_{0}}{E-\tilde\delta}\int{dr'}\,\phi_{0}^{*}(r')Y(r')\chi\br{r'}
\end{equation}
Note that here $\phi_{0}$ is normalized (for radial component).  Put this back to \sch equation of open-channel component $\chi$ (Eq. \ref{eq:intro:open}), 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro:chi}
\br{-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{r}}\frac{d^{2}}{dr^{2}}-U-E}\chi+\frac{1}{E-\tilde\delta}\int_{0}^{\infty}K(r\,r')\chi(r')dr'=0
\end{equation}
where kernel $K(r\,r')$ is
\begin{equation}
K(r\,r')\equiv\phi_{0}(r)\phi_{0}(r')Y(r')Y(r)\equiv{}K(r'\,r)
\end{equation}
Compare this with open-channel scattering \sch equation without coupling to closed-channel
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro:chi0}
\br{-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{r}}\frac{d^{2}}{dr^{2}}-U-E}\chi_{0}=0
\end{equation}
Note that $\chi_{0}(r)\rightarrow0$ as $r\rightarrow0$ and $\chi_{0}(r)\rightarrow\text{const}(1-r/a_{bg})$ for $r\rightarrow\infty$\footnote{Note that we are dealing with the internal wave function $\chi_{0}$ here (in region $\mathcal{I}$) instead of the external wave function as in Sec. \ref{sec:intro:as}, therefore, the boundary condition for $r\rightarrow0$ there actually corresponds boundary condition $r\rightarrow\infty$ here.}  Now multiply Eq. \ref{eq:intro:chi} with $\chi_{0}$ and Eq. \ref{eq:intro:chi0} with $\chi$, subtract them, and use Green's theorem, we find 
\begin{equation}
\chi_{0}(r_{c})\chi'(r_{c})-\chi_{0}'(r_{c})\chi(r_{c})+\frac{2m_{r}E}{\hbar^{2}}\int_{0}^{r_{c}}dr\chi_{0}(r)\chi(r)
=\frac{2m_{r}/\hbar^{2}}{E-\tilde\delta}\int_{0}^{r_{c}}dr\int_{0}^{r_{c}}dr'\chi_{0}(r)K(rr')\chi(r')
\end{equation}
Here $r_{c}$ is a  distance much larger than potential range, and we can use the boundary condition by let $r\rightarrow\infty$, $\chi_{0}(r)\rightarrow\text{const}(1-r/a_{bg})$, $\chi(r)\rightarrow\text{const}(1-r/a_{s})$.  The R.H.S approaches a constant for a short-range interaction $Y(r)$ and therefore $K(rr')$.  For scattering solution at  $E=0$, we have 
\begin{equation}
\nth{a_{s}}-\nth{a_{bg}}=\frac{2m_{r}/\hbar^{2}}{\tilde\delta}\int_{0}^{\infty}dr\int_{0}^{\infty}dr'\chi_{0}(r)K(rr')\chi(r')
\end{equation}
Contrary to na\"ive intuition, $a_{s}$ does not diverge at the point $\tilde\delta=0$ because of the original interaction in open-channel, $a_{bg}$.  We can define a quantity $\mathcal{K}$, the detuning where $a_{s}$ diverges, by the implicit equation ($\mathcal{K}$ shows up in R.H.S as well)
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro:kappa}
\mathcal{K}\equiv-\frac{2m_{r}a_{bg}}{\hbar^{2}}\int_{0}^{\infty}{dr}\int_{0}^{\infty}dr'\chi_{0}(r)K(rr')\chi_{\tilde\delta=\mathcal{K}}(r')
\end{equation}
And if we define the ``real detuning'' $\delta\equiv\tilde\delta-\mathcal{K}$, we have 
\begin{equation}
a_{s}(\delta)=a_{bg}\br{1+\frac{\kappa}{\delta}}
\end{equation}
Comparing this with the empirical formula of Feshbach resonance
\begin{equation}
a_{s}(B)=a_{bg}\br{1+\frac{\Delta{B}}{B-B_{0}}}
\end{equation}
We see that $\Delta{B}=\mathcal{K}(\partial\delta/\partial{B})^{-1}$, and $B_{0}$ is the real resonance position.  %Here $\partial\delta/\partial{B}$ is the magnetic momentum difference between two channels.

Next we consider the bound state \footnote{Here we want to stress the difference between a closed-channel bound-state $\phi_{i}$ and a real bound state with negative energy formed by two channels.   The closed-channel bound state $\phi_{i}$ is the eigenstate of the hamiltonian of isolated closed-channel, and is not a real eigenstate for the full two-channel hamiltonian.  On the other hand, the full  hamiltonian has eigenstate of bound-state ($E<0$) at large negative detuning (in two-body context) or BEC-side (in many-body context).  The bound state solution for two-channel eigenstate has components both in open-channel and closed-channel.  Often the open-channel weight is larger when close to resonance and therefore those bound-states are often called open-channel bound-states.  Only at large negative detuning, the real two-channel bound state is mostly composed of close-channel component, and coincides with close-channel bound-state, $\phi_{i}$.}
where $E<0$, define
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro:ab}
a_{b}(E)\equiv\frac{\hbar}{(2m_{r}\abs{E})^{1/2}}
\end{equation}
 Here we only study the bound state close to threshold with binding energy much smaller than the binding energy of closed-channel bound state $\phi_{0}$, $\abs{E}\ll{}E_{b}$, and therefore $a_{b}\gg{a_{c}}$.  Outside the range of potential $r_{c}$,  the wave function is proportional to $e^{-r/a_{b}}$. For $r_{c}\ll{}r\ll{}a_{b}$, it is approximately $1-\frac{r}{a_{b}}$, just as the Bethe-Peierls boundary condition (or s-wave scattering wave function) we discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:intro:as}.  Note that $a_{b}(E)$ is not identified as $a_{s}$ a priori.  We can go through the similar procedure as previous, and it is not hard to find
\begin{equation}
\frac{a_{bg}}{a_{b}}-1=\frac{-\mathcal{K}}{\delta+\mathcal{K}-E}
\end{equation}
Here we assume the short-range part of wave function $\chi$ does not change much and therefore $\mathcal{K}$ stays relatively constant.  Provided both $\delta$ and $\abs{E}$ are much smaller than $\mathcal{K}$, this leads to 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro:abKE}
a_{b}=\frac{\mathcal{K}}{\delta-E}
\end{equation}
It is not hard to see that $a_{b}$ coincides with s-wave scattering length $a_{s}$ when $\abs{E}\ll\abs{\delta}$, and therefore we will use them interchangeably afterward. This is actually an example our discussion about Bethe-Peierls boundary condition in Chapter \ref{sec:intro:as}.  Using Eqs. \ref{eq:intro:ab} and \ref{eq:intro:abKE}, it is easy to obtain an equation for $E$
\begin{equation}
(\abs{E}+\delta)^{2}-2\delta_{c}\abs{E}=0
\end{equation}
where $\delta_{c}$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro:deltaC}
\delta_{c}\equiv\frac{\mathcal{K}^{2}}{\hbar^{2}/m_{r}a_{bg}^{2}}
\end{equation}
And the solution is  (for $\delta<0$)
\begin{equation}
\abs{E}=\delta_{c}-\delta-\sqrt{\delta_{c}^{2}-2\delta\delta_{c}}
\end{equation}
Furthermore, we can calculate the ``relative weight'' (probability) of closed-channel 
\begin{equation}
\lambda=\br{\frac{1}{E-\tilde\delta}}^{2}\abs{\int{}dr'\phi_{0}(r')Y(r')\xi_{n}(r')}^{2}
\end{equation}
where $\xi_{n}(r)$ is the normalized open-channel bound-state component.  Comparing this with Eq. \ref{eq:intro:kappa}, assume the short-range part of $\chi_{n}(r)$ does not differ from $\chi_{o}(r)$ much, we can find 
\begin{equation}
\lambda=\nth{(E-\tilde\delta)^{2}}\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{r}a_{bg}}\mathcal{K}a_{b}^{-1}
\end{equation}
For $\abs{\delta}\lesssim\delta_{c}\ll\mathcal{K}$, $E-\tilde\delta\approx\mathcal{K}$ and we have 
\begin{equation}
\lambda=\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{r}a_{bg}}\nth{(\mathcal{K}a_{b})}=\br{\frac{\abs{E}}{2\delta_{c}}}^{1/2}
\end{equation}
Now we can see that  $\delta_{c}$ is a ``characteristic'' energy scale. When $\abs{\delta}\gg\delta_{c}$, $E\approx\delta$, this simply means that when the negative detuning is large, most weight is in closed-channel, and the real mixed bound state is a closed-channel bound state ($\phi_{0}$) dressed with little open-channel component and therefore the binding energy is roughly equal that of $\phi_{0}$.  On the contrary, when $\abs{\delta}\ll\delta_{c}$, $\abs{E}\approx-\delta^{2}/\delta_{c}\ll\delta$,  and closed-channel weight is much smaller than that of open-channel, the real bound-state is more or less a open-channel affair with little dress-up from closed-channel.  % It is not hard to  estimate $\delta_{c}$. 

In the many-body physics, another important energy scale comes into play, Fermi energy, $E_{F}$.  When it is much smaller than $\delta_{c}$, i.e. \emph{broad resonance},  closed-channel has only negligible weight close to resonance, where we are mostly interested in. In such situation, it is a good approximation to take Feshbach resonance as only a knob to tweak the interaction over open-channel there.  On the contrary, when $E_{F}$ is close even larger than $\delta_{c}$, i.e. \emph{narrow resonance}, closed-channel weight can be  significant around resonance, therefore requires to be explicitly taken into many-body framework.  










\chapter{Single-channel BEC-BCS crossover\label{sec:intro:1channel}}
In this chapter, we briefly review the BEC-BCS crossover in single channel.   The idea to describe the BEC and BCS in the same footing stems back several decades \cite{Eagle, LeggettCrossover, Nozieres, RanderiaBEC}.  %One way to interpret BCS is through the existing macroscopic eigenvalue of two-body density matrix (see Sec. \ref{sec:intro:as})\cite{Leggett}.   This eigenvalue corresponds the more familiar anomalous expectation, $\av{a_{\uparrow-\vk}a_{\downarrow\vk}}$.  If simply taking it as wave function of a two-fermion molecule, this eigenfucntion, $\ket{\psi}=(\sum_{\vk}c_{\vk}a^{\dg}_{\uparrow\vk}a^{\dg}_{\downarrow-\vk})\ket{0}$ is very large in size (coherent length), much larger than the average particle distance.  Therefore overlap between different ``molecules'' is significant.   
BCS theory can be understood as the fermions form  ``giant molecules'' and those molecules then condense simultaneously.    It is not hard to show that the famous BCS ansatz is equivalent to  the  coherent state of two-body pair $\psi^{\dg}=\sum_{\vk}c_{\vk}a^{\dg}_{\uparrow\vk}a^{\dg}_{\downarrow-\vk}$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro:BCScoherent}
\prod_{\vk}(u_{vk}+v_{\vk}a^{\dg}_{\uparrow\vk}a^{\dg}_{\downarrow-\vk})\ket{0}=A\exp{}(\sum_{\vk}c_{\vk}a^{\dg}_{\uparrow\vk}a^{\dg}_{\downarrow-\vk})\ket{0}
\end{equation}
where $c_{\vk}=( v_{\vk}/u_{\vk})$. The size of these ``giant molecules'' is in the order of coherent length and much larger than inter-particle distance.
Moving away from BCS ends, the pair shrinks as the inter-particle attraction becomes stronger.  At BEC side, two-fermion molecules are smaller than inter-particle distance and therefore well-defined. However, the binding energy now is much higher than typical many-body energy scale and condensation does not happens at the same time when molecules form.  Nevertheless,  at low enough temperature, we can still consider the condensation and molecule-forming at the same time, within the same framework as in BCS.  

In the single-channel BEC-BCS crossover model, one images a ``magic'' knob that can tunes the interaction strength along the crossover.  The many-body fermion  system sweeps from fermionic BCS to BEC of molecules of two fermions in response to interaction change.   This applies directly to the broad-resonance, where the closed-channel weight is negligible and serves only to modify the effective interaction strength in open-channel.  We mostly follow path-integral treatment in \cite{RanderiaBEC, Randeria1997, Randeria2008} because it is readily adapted for two-channel model in the next chapter.
