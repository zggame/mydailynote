\subsection{Tony's comment}
He agrees my assumption, that at low-k, close-channel weight is always small.  He raises the question: how to describe the high-total-weight of close channel?  He is a bit suspicious about my conclusion that collective mode acquires a finite gap.  He feels it might violate sum rule (f sum-rule in particular).
