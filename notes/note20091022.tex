\subsection{More from Baym}
I talked with him more today.  He looked into my solution of Green's function.  He suggested me to think in the limit, $\Delta^F=0$ (one-channel with uneven chemical potential) or $\Delta^R=0$ (simple one-channel).  And he showed me how to relate from the k-space to r-space in simple one-channel.
