\subsection{}
Some arguments in last section \ref{sec:20100908:idea} seems incorrect, at least the argument that in close-channel zero-blocked  or one-pair-blocked within $k_{c}$ dominated multi-pair-blocked situation for open-channel BCS ansatz seems incorrect.  Therefore the argument in the following section \ref{sec:20100908:cal} becomes more or less irrelevant.  Nevertheless, the observation that close-channel bound state is relatively small in real space and therefore much extended in k-space is still useful.  Looked back \eef{eq:uvw:F}, (ignored Hatree terms)
\begin{equation}\tag{\ref{eq:uvw:F}}
 \begin{split}
  &F\equiv\av{H-\mu{}N}\\
    =&\sum(\xi^{ab}_\vk)\abs{v_\vk}^2+\nth2\sum_{\vk\neq\vk'}U_{\vk\vk'}v^{}_{\vk'}u^*_{\vk'}u^{}_\vk{}v^*_\vk\\
    &+\sum(\xi^{ac}_\vk)\abs{w_\vk}^2
      +\nth2\sum_{\vk\neq\vk'}V_{\vk\vk'}w^{}_{\vk'}u^*_{\vk'}u^{}_\vk{}w^*_\vk\\
    &  +\nth2\sum_{\vk\neq\vk'}Y_{\vk\vk'}w^{}_{\vk'}{u^{*}_{\vk'}}v^*_\vk{}u^{}_\vk
        +\nth2\sum_{\vk\neq\vk'}Y^*_{\vk\vk'}w^*_{\vk}{u^{}_{\vk}}v^{}_{\vk'}{}u^{*}_{\vk'}
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
It is useful to recognize that $w_{\vk}$ (or maybe $G_{\vk}=u_{\vk}w_{\vk}$) is always small. Changing  $w_{\vk}$ into $G_{\vk}$ in term $\sum(\xi^{ac}_\vk)\abs{w_\vk}^2$ introduces two problems:  First, the $w_{\vk}$ is finite, but it is small and error is probably small too;  second, within $k_{c}$, $v_{\vk}$ is substantial and therefore reduce the $u_{\vk}$ and makes $G_{\vk}$ much smaller than $w_{\vk}$, the error introduced here is probably also small because $w_{\vk}$ is small within $k_{c}$ and therefore the summation is small comparing to the term itself.  
So we have the free energy as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:20100909:F}
 \begin{split}
    F=&\sum(\xi^{ab}_\vk)\abs{v_\vk}^2+\nth2\sum_{\vk\neq\vk'}U_{\vk\vk'}F^{}_{\vk'}F^*_\vk\\
    &+\sum(\xi^{ac}_\vk)\abs{G_\vk}^2
      +\nth2\sum_{\vk\neq\vk'}V_{\vk\vk'}G^{}_{\vk'}G^*_\vk\\
    &  +\nth2\sum_{\vk\neq\vk'}Y_{\vk\vk'}G^{}_{\vk'}F^*_\vk{}
        +\nth2\sum_{\vk\neq\vk'}Y^*_{\vk\vk'}G^*_{\vk}F^{}_{\vk'}
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
Take $F_{\vk}$ and $G_{\vk}$ as variables, first we express $v_{\vk}$ in term of them.  We have  $\abs{u_\vk}^2+\abs{v_\vk}^2+\abs{w_\vk}^2=1$, here we replace  $w_{\vk}$  with  $G_{\vk}$  again.  We have 
\[
\begin{split}
v_{\vk}^2=&\nth{2}(1-G_{\vk}^{2}+\sqrt{(1-G_{\vk}^{2})^{2}-4F_{\vk}^{2}})\qquad (\epsilon_{\vk}<\mu)\\
	=&\nth{2}(1-G_{\vk}^{2}-\sqrt{(1-G_{\vk}^{2})^{2}-4F_{\vk}^{2}})\qquad (\epsilon_{\vk}\geq\mu)
\end{split}
\]
In BEC side ($\mu<0$), only the second form exists. (This sign problem is not important anyway as we can freely add a overall phase to $F_{\vk}$ or $u,v$, as mostly we just deal with the square of these quantities. ).   Just put the second case into the free energy \eef{eq:20100909:F}, take derivative over $F_{\vk}$, (take it as real, not complex) we find 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:20100909:fEq}
\epsilon^{ab}_{\vk}(\frac{2F_{\vk}}{\sqrt{(1-G_{\vk}^{2})^{2}-4F_{\vk}^{2}}})+\sum_{\vk'}(U_{\vk\vk'}F_{\vk'}+Y_{\vk\vk'}G_{\vk'})=0
\end{equation}
Define the normal gap parameters 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:20100909:gap}
\Delta^{F}_{\vk}=-\sum_{\vk'}(U_{\vk\vk'}F_{\vk'}+Y_{\vk\vk'}G_{\vk'})
\end{equation}
And we find
\begin{equation}
F_{\vk}=\frac{(1-G_{\vk}^{2})\Delta^{F}_{\vk}}{2\sqrt{(\epsilon^{ab}_{\vk}-\mu)^{2}+\Delta^{F}_{\vk}{}^{2}}}
\end{equation}
For low-k ($k<k_{c}$), both $U_{\vk\vk'}$ and $Y_{\vk\vk'}$ varies slowly, so $\Delta^{F}_{\vk}$ varies slowly and we can drop subscript $\vk$ and treat it as constant.  \eef{eq:20100909:fEq} describe the many-body effects when comparing with the two-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation.  $(1-G^{2})$ gives the pauli exclusion from the close-channel, the square root takes into account the pauli exclusion within open-channel.  

\eef{eq:20100909:gap} cannot be renormalized due to the extra factor $(1-G_{\vk}^{2})$.  A close look reveal that it does not reduce to normal \sch equation due to this extra factor.  This is puzzling.  It might be caused by replace $w_{\vk}$ with $G_{\vk}$.  Another possibility is that the coupled equation cannot be renormalized in this way, it has to be renormalized in the two-channel fashion, for the diagonalized  basis.  

\subsection{Tony's comment}
Tony takes \eef{eq:20100909:gap} as renormalized density of states.  From there, the two-body problem is also modified for this renormalized DoS. 

He suggested me to take $u_{\vk}$ as single-channel result for $G_{\vk}$.   

He encourage me to think about whether close-channel is significantly modified within $k_{F}$, he does not give me a definitive answer.  I feel this might relate to the real close-channel potential that support the bound state.  Not clear idea anyway.  
------ This is probably not modified as close-channel is much higher due to Zeeman energy.  This bare detuning corresponding the size of the close-channel bound state and therefore larger than any other energy scale.   It is the bound state level that close to 0 of open-channel.  By simple energy consideration, it is very disadvantageous to populate any close-channel low k state at all due to the high kinetic energy (with Zeeman energy).  It is only energetic feasible to populate it in the bound-state way where the potential energy gaining is sufficient to compensate the large kinetic energy.  

He also stress that I need to keep an eye on things thrown away in approximation,  whether they are in the order of kept terms.  

\subsection{}
The difference between $w_{\vk}$ and $G_{\vk}$ are introduced because of the grand-canonical nature of the ansatz?  In BCS side, this introduce really small error as $\Delta{N}$ can be shown are small.  Does that hold in BEC end?
\begin{equation}
\Delta{N}=\av{N-N^{2}}=\sum{\abs{v_{\vk}}^{2}-\abs{v_{\vk}}^{4}}=\sum{\abs{F_{\vk}}^{2}}
	=\sum{\abs{\frac{\Delta}{2E}}^{2}}
\end{equation}
This is extremely small for the BCS-side, but not the case in BEC-end.  (\emph{Interesting problem!})

One thing potentially useful is that to distinguish the region within $k_{c}$ and without where $G_{\vk}$ ($w_{\vk}$) is small comparing to open-channel or not.
