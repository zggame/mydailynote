\subsection{}
Tony suggested that probably both close and open channel need some non-zero center of mass momentum components in hamiltonian for excitation

\subsection{number uncertainty of close channel}
In my model, close-channel is pretty much proportional to two-body solution.  And it probably has much less number uncertainty.
