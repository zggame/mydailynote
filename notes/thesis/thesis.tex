\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
This thesis would not be possible without the guidance and patience from my advisor, Prof. Anthony J. Leggett.  I would like to thank Prof. Monique Combescot from Paris especially for her help, kindness and lots of invaluable advise.  Also, I would like to thank Dr. Wei-Cheng Lee, Dr. Shizhong Zhang, Dr. Parag Ghosh for their many discussion and suggestion.  Finally I would thank my wife and my family for constant support and affection all the time.  

%% The thesis format requires the Table of Contents to come
%% before any other major sections, all of these sections after

%% not \chapter*).  Common sections to have between the Table of
%% Contents and the main text are:

%% List of Tables
%% List of Figures
%% List Symbols and/or Abbreviations
%% etc.

\chapter{List of Symbols}

\begin{symbollist}[0.7in]
\item[$\psi$] wave function.
\item[$\phi_{i}$] Bound-state wave functions of  isolated close-channel, especially, $\phi_{0}$ is the one in resonance (\pageref{eq:pathInt2:phi})
\item[$D_{1,2}$] Order parameters for two-channels. (\pageref{eq:pathInt2:Ddef})
\item[$h_{1\vk} h_{2\vk}$] (Open, close) psudo-wave-function of two-body correlation (\pageref{eq:pathInt2:h2})
\item[$a_{s}$, $a_{s}^{(o)}$] (Open channel) s-wave scattering length, (we drop subscript ${}^{(o)}$ when there is no ambuguity) 
\item[$\eta$] Absolute detuning between two channels, notice that $\eta=0$ is not where $a_{s}$ diverges
\item[$E_{b}$, $E_{b}^{(i)}$] Binding energy of $i^{th}$ two-body (bound) eigen-wave-function in isolated close-channel.  Superscript ${}^{(i)}$ is dropped when referring the one in resonance. 
\item[$\kappa$] Momentum scale of the resonant bound-state in isolated close-channel.  $\kappa^{2}/2m=E_{b}$
\item[$\delta_{c}$] Energy scale of relative detuning from resonance where close-channel take substantial weight
\item[$a_{0}$] Average particle-particle distance, $a_{0}k_{F}\sim1$
\item[$k_{F}$] Fermi momentum
\item[$\gamma_{i\vk}$] Correction of ferimionic excitation spectrum over $\pm{}E$ and $\epsilon_{\vk}+\eta$ (\pageref{eq:pathInt2:xiExpand})
