In this thesis, we studied the narrow resonance, especially the case where two channels share the same species.  In general, for narrow resonance without shared species, the main correction is that the weight in close channel.  The number equation is not the total density but the density of open-channel, as in  \cite{GurarieNarrow}.  However, when there is common species,  Pauli exclusion between two channels need to be considered carefully for narrow resonance.  When the close channel bound state is in the order of   inter-particle distance, it is really a three species many-body problem and no obvious solution is available.  However, when this bound-state is much smaller than inter-particle distance, this ratio ($r_{c}/a_{0}$) serves as the expanding coefficient and we can extracted the effect perturbatively.  A few new parameters needs to be introduced and can be calibrated from experiments.  System's mean field property can still be determined by gap equations and number equations as in single-channel problem.  The excitation modes are also close to the original single-channel result with correction in order of $r_{c}/a_{0}$.
