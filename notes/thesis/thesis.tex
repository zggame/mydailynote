\begin{abstract}
BEC-BCS crossover problem was intensively studied both theoretically and experimentally largely thanks to the Feshbach resonance via which effective interaction of alkali gas is tuned.  In Feshbach resonance, there is one characteristic energy scale $\delta_c$. Close-channel component only dominates when the detuning from resonance is more than $\delta_c$.  When many-body scale (e.g. Fermi energy) is larger than $\delta_c$, close-channel is important enough to be included into the many-body theory.  Furthermore, when two-channels share the same hyperfine species as in the two most available experiments systems (${}^6\text{Li}$ and ${}^{40}\text{K}$), Pauli exclusion between two channels also needs to be taken into consideration of the many-body theory.  This thesis addresses this problem in details. A set of gap equations and number equations is are derived at mean-field level.  Fermionic and bosonic excitation spectrum is also derived within this model.  In all the cases, if assuming the bound-state of close-channel in resonance is much smaller than interparticle distance as well as s-wave scattering length $a_s$, we find that  the basic conclusion in broad resonance is still valid. In every case, correction is  in order of $E_F/\eta$.

\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
First I would like to thank my adviser, Prof. Anthony J. Leggett.  This thesis would not be possible without his guidance and patience.  I would like to thank Prof. Monique Combescot from Paris especially for her help, kindness and lots of invaluable advise.  Also, I would like to thank Dr. Wei-Cheng Lee, Dr. Shizhong Zhang, Dr. Parag Ghosh,  Douglas
Packard  for their many discussion and suggestion.  Finally I would thank my wife and my family for constant support and affection.

\chapter{List of Symbols}

\begin{symbollist}[0.7in]
%\item[$\psi$] Wave function.
\item[$\phi_{i}$] Bound-state wave functions of  isolated close-channel, especially, $\phi_{0}$ is the one in resonance. (Page \pageref{eq:pathInt2:phi})
\item[$D_{1,2}$] Order parameters for two-channels. (Page \pageref{eq:pathInt2:Ddef})
\item[$h_{1\vk} h_{2\vk}$] (Open, close) (anomalous) two-body correlation in many-body system. (Page \pageref{eq:pathInt2:h2})
\item[$a_{s}$, $a_{s}^{(o)}$] (Open channel) s-wave scattering length. Subscript ${}^{(o)}$ is dropped when there is no ambiguity. (Page \pageref{sec:intro:as})
\item[$\eta$] Absolute detuning between two channels. Notice that $\eta=0$ is not where $a_{s}$ diverges. (Page \pageref{eq:intro:ham})
\item[$E_{b}$, $E_{b}^{(i)}$] Binding energy of $i^{th}$ two-body (bound) eigen-wave-function in isolated close-channel.  Superscript ${}^{(i)}$ is dropped when referring the one in resonance. (Page \pageref{eq:intro:sch2})
\item[$\kappa$] Momentum scale of the resonant bound-state in isolated close-channel.  $\kappa^{2}/2m=E_{b}$.
\item[$\delta_{c}$] Energy scale of relative detuning from resonance where close-channel take substantial weight. (Page \pageref{eq:intro:deltaC})
\item[$a_{0}$] Average inter-particle distance, $a_{0}k_{F}\sim1$.
\item[$r_{c}$] Potential range.  We can take all (inter/intra)-channel potential as zero outside $r_{c}$.
\item[$a_{c}$] Characteristic size of bound state in resonance ($\phi_{0}$) if close-channel is isolated, a typical wave-function is $\sim{}e^{-r/a_{c}}$. It relates to inverse of $\kappa$.
\item[$k_{F}$] Fermi momentum.
\item[$\gamma_{i\vk}$] Correction of ferimionic excitation spectrum over $\pm{}E$ and $\epsilon_{\vk}+\eta$. (Page \pageref{eq:pathInt2:xiExpand})
