\section{Formalism for composite bosons\label{sec:formalism}}
\subsection{Free pairs}
We consider free pair states with one degree of freedom only, namely
\begin{equation}\label{eq:beta}
\beta_\vk^\dg=a^\dg_{\vk\uparrow}{}a^\dg_{-\vk\downarrow}
\end{equation}
 In BCS superconductivity, these free fermions feel a potential which acts in a potential layer of extension $\Omega$ above a frozen Fermi sea $|F_0{\rangle}$, namely
\begin{equation}
V_{BCS}=-V\sum_{\vk'\vk}w_{\vk'}w_{\vk}\beta^\dg_{\vk'}\beta^{}_\vk
\label{eq:}
\end{equation}
with $w_\vk=1$ for $\epsilon_{F_0}<\epsilon_\vk<\epsilon_{F_0}+\Omega$. 

The statistical properties of free pair states follow from their composite boson nature. It shows up through
\begin{equation}  
\left[\beta^{\dagger}_{\mathbf{k} ^{\prime}},\beta^{\dagger}_{\mathbf{k} }%
\right]  =0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:betacom}
\left[\beta_{\mathbf{k} ^{\prime}},\beta^{\dagger}_{\mathbf{k} }\right] 
=\delta_{\mathbf{k} ^{\prime}\mathbf{k} }-\mathit{D} _{\mathbf{k} ^{\prime}%
\mathbf{k} }
\end{equation}
where the operator $\mathit{D} _{\mathbf{k} ^{\prime}\mathbf{k} }$ is equal to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:D}
\mathit{D} _{\mathbf{k} ^{\prime}\mathbf{k} }=\delta_{\mathbf{k} ^{\prime}\mathbf{k}}\sum_{s=(\uparrow,\downarrow)}a^\dg_{\vk{s}}{}a^{}_{\vk{s}}
\end{equation}
 so that, when acting on another free pair, it gives
\begin{equation}
\left[\mathit{D} _{\mathbf{p}\mathbf{k} ^{}_1},\beta^{\dagger}_{%
\mathbf{k} _2}\right]  =2\delta_{\mathbf{k}_1 \mathbf{p} }\delta_{\mathbf{k}_2 \mathbf{p} }\beta_\vp^\dg
\end{equation}

The interaction properties of these free pairs follow from commutations with the system hamiltonian $H=H_0+V_{BCS}$, the kinetic part reading as $H_0=\sum_{\vk{s}}\epsilon_\vk{}a^\dg_{\vk{s}}a^{}_{\vk{s}}$. We then find
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:betaH}
\left[H_0,\beta^{\dagger}_\vp\right]  =2\epsilon_\vp\beta^{\dagger}_\vp
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:vbeta}
\left[V_{BCS},\beta^{\dagger}_\vp\right] 
=-Vw^{}_\vp\beta^{\dagger}+V^{\dagger}_\vp
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
\beta^{\dagger}=\sum_\vp{}w_\vp\beta^{\dagger}_\vp
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
V^\dg_\vp=-Vw^{}_\vp\beta^{\dagger}\sum_s{}a^\dg_{\vp{s}}a^{}_{\vp{s}}
\end{equation}
Due to the $w_\vp$ part of this $V^\dg_\vp$ operator, we do have $V^\dg_\vp|F_0{\rangle}=0$ while 
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:vpotbeta}
\left[V^{\dagger}_{\mathbf{p} _2},\beta^{\dagger}_{\mathbf{p} _1}\right] 
=2V\delta_{\mathbf{p} _1\mathbf{p} _2}w_{\mathbf{p} _1}\beta^{\dagger}_{\mathbf{p} _1}\beta^{\dagger}_{}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Correlated pairs}

%It is actually quite easy to write the recursive relation fulfilled by the $f_N$'s.  For that let us introduce the operator

We now consider correlated pairs, i.e., linear combination of free pairs which, unlike excitons, are not  one-pair eigenstates of the system hamiltonian.  It is convenient to introduce their generalized form defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:C}
{C}_m^\dg=\sum{(w_\vk\varphi_\vk)}^{2m+1}\beta^\dg_\vk
\end{equation}
with  $\varphi_\vk$ normalized by 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cNormal}
\langle{}F_0|{C_0^{ }}{C_0^\dg}|F_0{\rangle}=\sum{w_\vk}|\varphi_\vk|^{2}=1
\end{equation}
The commutators between free pairs introduced above lead to  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ID}
[{C}_{m'},C^\dg_m]=I_{1+m+m'}-D_{m'm}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
[{D}_{m'_1,m_1},C^\dg_{m_2}]=2C^\dg_{1+m_1+m'_1+m_2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
I_m=\sum|w_\vk\varphi_\vk|^{2m}
\end{equation}
with $I_1=1$ due to eq. (\ref{eq:cNormal}).

  It is possible to extend the above commutation relations by recursion to $N$ correlated pairs.  We find
\begin{equation}
[{D}_{m0},C^\dg_{0}{}^N]=2N{C^\dg_{0}}^{N-1}C^\dg_{m+1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
[{C}_{m},C^\dg_{0}{}^N]=N{C^\dg_0}^{(N-1)}(I_{1+m}-D_{n0})-N(N-1)C^\dg_{m+1}{C^\dg_{0}}^{N-2}
\end{equation}

These $N$-commutators are necessary to calculate an important quantity for the control of Pauli blocking between correlated pairs, namely the normalization factor
\begin{equation}
\langle{}F_0|{C_0^{ }}{}^N{C_0^\dg}{}^N|F_0{\rangle}=N!f_N
\end{equation}
If $C^\dg_0$ were the creation operator of an elementary boson, i.e., for $[C_0,C^\dg_0]$ reducing to 1,  $f_N$ would reduce to 1 for all $N$.  The $f_N$ factor actually is the signature of the "moth-eaten effect" between composite bosons induced by the Pauli exclusion principle.  As a result of this effect, $f_N$ is a decreasing function of $N$. A way to show it is through  the recursion relation fulfilled by the $f_N$'s.  Since $D_{m'm}|F_0\rangle=0 $  as readily seen from Eq. (\ref{eq:ID}) acting on $|F_0\rangle$, the above $N$-commutators give,  since $I_1=1$ 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split} 
\langle{}F_0|{C_0^{ }}{}^N{C_0^\dg}{}^N|F_0{\rangle}&
	=\langle{}F_0|{C_0^{ }}{}^{N-1}[C_0,{C_0^\dg}{}^N]|F_0{\rangle}\\
	&=N\langle{}F_0|{C_0^{ }}{}^{N-1}{C_0^\dg}{}^{N-1}|F_0{\rangle}
	-N(N-1)\langle{}F_0|{C_0^{ }}{}^{N-1}C_1^\dg{C_0^\dg}{}^{N-1}|F_0{\rangle}\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
To calculate the second term, we  use $[C_0^{N-1},C_1^\dg]$ with $\langle{}F_0|C^\dg_1=0$ due to the $w_\vk$ factor included in $C^\dg_1$. By repeating the process, we end with the following recursion relation between the $f_N$'s 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fn}
f_N=f_{N-1}-(N-1)I_2f_{N-2}+(N-1)(N-2)I_3f_{N-3}-\cdots+(-1)^{N-1}N!I_Nf_0
\end{equation}
where $f_0=1$. 

The above equation is convenient to calculate $f_N$ when the RHS is dominated by its first terms, i.e., when the prefactors $N^pI_{p+1}$ are small.  This happens for excitons,  and more generally for correlated pairs in the dilute limit.  In the dense limit however, when Pauli blocking becomes dramatic, the compact form of  $f_N$   given by 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fn2}
\begin{split}
f_N=\left.\frac{\partial^NZ(x)}{\partial{x^N}}\right|_{x=0}\\
Z(x)=\prod_\vk(1+x|w_\vk\varphi_\vk|^2)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
turns out to be far more convenient. It is easy to check that Eq.(\ref{eq:fn2}) actually leads to Eq.(\ref{eq:fn}).

\subsection{Correlated pairs with a flat distribution}
The simplest correlated pair corresponds to replace $\varphi_\vk$ by a constant for all $\epsilon_\vk$ between $\epsilon_{F_0}$ and $\epsilon_{F_0}+\rho_0N^*$ where $\rho_0$ is the density of states taken as constant above the frozen sea $|F_0\rangle$, i.e., for $\epsilon_\vk>\epsilon_{F_0}$. The $N^*$'s of physical interest are smaller than the total number of pairs $N_\Omega=\rho_0\Omega$ feeling the potential - pairs with energy above $\epsilon_{F_0}+\rho_0N^*$ being anyway cut by the $w_\vk$ factor appearing in the definition (\ref{eq:C}) of $C_m^\dg$.  This amounts to put $N^*$ free pairs $\beta_{\vk_1}^\dg,\;\cdots,\beta_{\vk_{N^*}}^\dg$ in the sum of $C_0^\dg$, all with the same weight $\varphi^*=1/\sqrt{N^*}$ in order to have $I_1=1$.  Consequently
\begin{equation}
C^\dg_0=\frac1{\sqrt{N^*}}S^\dg_{N^*}
\end{equation}
 where  $S_N^\dg$ for arbitrary $N$ is defined as $S_N^\dg=\sum_{n=1}^N\beta^\dg_{\vk_n}$. 

It is clear that due to Pauli blocking, we cannot pile up more correlated pairs than the number of $\vk$ states available in the $C^\dg_0$ sum.  This readily proves that
\begin{equation}
f_N=0\quad \mbox{for}\quad N\geq{}N^*+1
\end{equation}
To get $f_N$ when $N$ is exactly equal to the number $N^*$ of $\vk$ states in the $C^\dg_0$ sum, we note that, since $\beta^\dg_\vk{}^2=0$ due to Pauli blocking,
\begin{equation}
(S_{N^*}^\dg)^{N^*}=[S^\dg_{N^*-1}+\beta^\dg_{\vk_{N^*}}]^{N^*}=(S_{N^*-1}^\dg)^{N^*}+N^*\beta^\dg_{\vk_{N^*}}(S_{N^*-1}^\dg)^{N^*-1}
\end{equation}
The first term reduces to zero since we cannot pile up more pairs than the available number $N^*-1$ of $\vk$ states in the $S^\dg_{N^*-1}$ sum. By iterating the process, we end with 
\begin{equation}
(S^\dg_{N^*})^{N*}=N^*!\prod_{i=1,\dots,N^*}\beta_{\vk_i}^+
\end{equation}
 so that 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:FnSn}
\langle{F_0}|(S_{N^*}^{})^{N^*}(S_{N^*}^\dg)^{N^*}|F_0\rangle=(N^*!)^2
\end{equation}
Since this scalar product is nothing but $(N^*)^{N^*}\langle{}v|C_0{}^{N^*}C_0^\dg{}^{N^*}|v\rangle$, we readily find \begin{equation}
f_{N^*}=N^*!/(N^*)^{N^*}\approx{}e^{-N^*}\sqrt{2\pi{N^*}}
\end{equation}
 for $N^*$ large, due to the Stirling formula. 
 
 If we now use the same procedure for $N=N^*-1$, we find 
 \begin{equation}
 \begin{split}
\langle{F_0}|(S_{N^*}^{})^{N^*-1}(S_{N^*}^\dg)^{N^*-1}|F_0\rangle
=&\langle{F_0}|(S_{N^*-1}^{})^{N^*-1}(S_{N^*-1}^\dg)^{N^*-1}|F_0\rangle\\
&+(N^*-1)^2\langle{F_0}|(S_{N^*-1}^{})^{N^*-2}(S_{N^*-1}^\dg)^{N^*-2}|F_0\rangle
\end{split}
\end{equation} 
Due to Eq. (\ref{eq:FnSn}), the first term is just equal to $[(N^*-1)!]^2$. By iterating the process, the above product ends by being equal to $N^*(N^*-1)!^2$, which gives $f_{N^*-1}=N^*!/(N^*)^{N^*-1}$.  This $f_{N^*-1}$ allows us to calculate $f_{N^*-2}$ and so on ...  We ultimately end with
\begin{equation}
f_N=\frac{N^*!}{(N^*-N)!N^*{}^N}=f_{N^*}\frac{(N^*)^{N^*-N}}{(N^*-N)!}
\end{equation}
It is easy to check that  the above $f_N$ fulfills Eq. (\ref{eq:fn}) since for such a flat distribution, $I_m$ reduces to $1/(N^*)^{m-1}$.
\subsection{Correlated pairs with a triangular distribution}
We now considered correlated pairs made of the same amount of $\vk$ states, namely $\vk_1,\dots,\vk_{N^*}$, but with a linearly decreasing weight, taken as 
\begin{equation}
 \varphi_{\vk_n}=\sqrt{\frac{3}{N^*}}\frac{\epsilon_{F_0}+\rho_0^{-1}N^*-\epsilon_{\vk_n}}{\rho_0^{-1}N^*}
\end{equation}
this distribution being properly normalized as $\sum|\varphi_\vk|^2=1$.  Using Eq.(\ref{eq:fn2}), we can show that 
\begin{gather}
f_{N^*}=\Pi^*N^*!\\
\mbox{where}\quad \Pi^*=\prod_{i=1}^{N^*}|\varphi_{k_i} |^2\notag
\end{gather}
Similarly, we can find
\begin{equation}
 f_{N^*-1}=\Pi^*(N^*-1)!\sum_{i}\frac{1}{|\varphi_{\vk_i}|^2}\approx\Pi^*(N^*-1)!\frac{\pi^2}{6}\frac{N^*{}^3}{3}
\end{equation}
so that $\frac{f_{N^*-1}}{f_{N^*}}=N^*{}^2\frac{\pi^2}{18}$ instead of being of the order of $N^*$ as in the flat case: 

STRANGE !!!

 $f_n$ decreases faster for a triangular distribution, as expected because the distribution is esentially concentrated in the low energy part of the distribution which makes more affected by Pauli blocking.   





\subsection{Correlated pairs with a two-step distribution}
A third distribution of physical interest is a flat distribution with a tail, namely
\begin{equation}
 \begin{split}
  \varphi_\vk=\varphi_1&\; \mbox{for}\quad{}\epsilon_{F_0}<\epsilon_\vk<\epsilon_{F_0}+\rho_0^{-1}N_1\\
  \varphi_\vk=\varphi_2&\; \mbox{for}\quad{}\epsilon_{F_0}+\rho_0^{-1}N_1<\epsilon_\vk<\epsilon_{F_0}+\rho_0^{-1}(N_1+N_2)\\
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
with $N_1+N_2=N^*$. In the limit $\varphi_1\gg\varphi_2$ and $N_1\gg{}N_2$, such a two-step distribution turns out to be of physical relevance in the case of BCS composite bosons as shown more in details below. 

The normalized pair creation operator then reads
\begin{equation}
C^\dg=\varphi_1(\beta^\dg_{\vk_1}+\cdots+\beta^\dg_{\vk_{N_1}})+\varphi_2(\Gamma^\dg_{\vk_{1}}+\cdots+\Gamma^\dg_{\vk_{N_2}})
\end{equation}
where the $\beta^\dg$'s create pair in the main part, $(\epsilon_{F_0},\epsilon_{F_0}+\rho_0^{-1}N_1)$, while $\Gamma^\dg$'s create pairs in the tail, $(\epsilon_{F_0}+\rho_0^{-1}N_1,\epsilon_{F_0}+\rho_0^{-1}(N_1+N_2))$.
This leads to\begin{equation}
C^\dg{}^m=\sum_{l=\max\{0,m-N_2\}}^{\min\{N_1,m\}}\varphi_1^l\varphi_2^{m-l}\prod_{t=1}^{l}\beta^\dg_{\vk_{i_t}}\prod_{t^\prime=1}^{m-l}\Gamma^\dg_{\vk_{j_{t^\prime}}}
\end{equation}
And this gives
\begin{equation}
\langle{}C^mC^\dg{}^m\rangle=\sum_{l=\max\{0,m-N_2\}}^{\min\{N_1,m\}}|\varphi_1|^{2l}|\varphi_2|^{2(m-l)}
\frac{l!(m-l)!}{l!(N_1-l)!(N_2-m+l)!}N_1!N_2!\equiv\sum_{l=\max\{0,m-N_2\}}^{\min\{N_1,m\}}S_l
\end{equation}
Let us look at $S_l$ more carefully
\begin{equation}
\frac{S_l}{S_{l-1}}=\left|\frac{\varphi_1}{\varphi_2}\right|^2\frac{l(N_1-l+1)}{(m-l+1)(N_2-m+l)}
\end{equation}
For $l$, $m$ in the same order as $N_1$, $N_1-l+1\sim1$, $m-l+1\sim1$, $N2-m+l\sim{N_2}$, so the above ratio is in the order of $\left|\frac{\varphi_1}{\varphi_2}\right|^2\frac{N_1}{N_2}\gg1$ and we can drop every term except the last one. This means that the dominating part in the wave function fills the main part and very little fills the tail.  
\begin{equation}
f_m=
\begin{cases}
\left|{\varphi_1}^{m}\right|^2\frac{N_1!}{(N_1)!}&m\leq{}N_1\\
\left|{\varphi_1}^{N_1}{\varphi_2}^{-(m-N_1)}\right|^2\frac{N!(m-N_1)!N_1!N_2!}{m!(N_2+N_1-m)!}&m>N_1
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\section{Richardson's exact eigenstate}
Richardson has shown that the \emph{exact} $N$-pair eigenvalues of the system hamiltonian $H=H_0+V_{BCS}$ read as $E_N=R_1+\cdots{}R_N$, the eigenstates being
\begin{equation}\label{eq:phiN}
|\Psi_N{\rangle}=B^{\dagger}(R_1)\cdots{}B^{\dagger}(R_N)|F_0{\rangle}  
\end{equation}
$B^{\dagger}(R)$ turns out to be a simple generalization of the one-pair solution obtained by Cooper, namely
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:B}
B^{\dagger}(R)=\sum_\vk\frac{w_\vk}{2\epsilon_\vk-R}\beta^{\dagger}_\vk
\end{equation}
while the $R_i$'s are solutions of $N$ coupled equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Rich}
1=V\sum\frac{w_{\mathbf{k} }}{2\epsilon_{\mathbf{k} }-R_i}+\sum_{j\neq{i}}%
\frac{2V}{R_i-R_j}\quad\qquad \text{for}\; i=\left(1,...,N\right) 
\end{equation}

We have been able to rederive this exact solution using a coboson approach based on the  commutators derived in section \ref{sec:formalism}.  This approach allowed us to associate the terms $2/(R_i-R_j)$ in these equations, to the Pauli exclusion principle between pairs.  Without these terms, the solution of the Richardson's equations would be $R_i=E_1$ where $E_1$, solution of
\begin{equation}
1=V\sum\frac{w_{\mathbf{k} }}{2\epsilon_{\mathbf{k} }-E_1}
\end{equation}
 is the single pair binding energy as obtained by Cooper, namely, $E_1=2E_{F_0}-\epsilon_c$ with $\epsilon_c\approx2\Omega{}e^{-2/\rho_0V}$ for $\rho_0V\ll1$. The fact that $E_N$ differs from the $NE_1$ comes from the $2/(R_i-R_j)$ terms in the Richardson's equations (\ref{eq:Rich})  which impose all the $R_i$'s to be different - otherwise these terms would diverge. As a direct consequence of all the $R_i$'s being different, the exact eigenstate given in Eq. (\ref{eq:phiN}), clearly differs from the commonly accepted idea  in BCS superconductivity, that all the pairs are condensed into the same state:  Indeed, the BCS $N$-pair state is said to read as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:phiNBcs}
|\Phi_N{\rangle}={B^{\dagger}}^N|F_0{\rangle}  
\end{equation}
where $B^\dagger$ is an appropriate linear combination of free pairs feeling the attractive BCS potential
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bBeta}
B^\dg=\sum_\vk w_{\mathbf{k} }\phi_\vk\beta^\dg_\vk
\end{equation}
the $w_{\mathbf{k} }$ factor actually being important for $B^\dg$ operator acting on $|F_0{\rangle}$. In the next paragraph, we are going to come back to the origin of this idea.  

\section{BCS  ansatz\label{sec:bcs}}
The BCS ansatz fundamentally corresponds to consider the linear combination of $N$ pair states $|\Phi_N>$ introduced above, and to affect to these states a weight $1/N!$, in order to possibly rewrite this sum in a compact form
\begin{equation}
|\Phi{\rangle}=\sum^\infty_{N=0}\frac{1}{N!}B^{\dg{}N}|F_0{\rangle}=e^{B^\dg}|F_0{\rangle}
\label{eq:BcsPhi}
\end{equation}
At this stage, the $1/N!$ prefactor appears as a convenient mathematical trick. Since the exponential of a sum is a product of exponentials, this state also reads 
\begin{equation}
|\Phi{\rangle}=\prod_\vk{}e^{\phi_\vk\beta^\dg_\vk}|F_0{\rangle}=\prod_\vk{}\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{n!}({\phi_\vk\beta^\dg_\vk})^n|F_0{\rangle}
\label{eq:BcsPhi2}
\end{equation}
By noting that the terms in the sum reduces to zero for $n>1$ due to Pauli blocking, we end by rewriting $|\Phi\rangle$ as 
\begin{equation}
|\Phi{\rangle}=\prod_\vk{}({1+\phi_\vk\beta^\dg_\vk})|F_0{\rangle}
\label{eq:BcsPhi3}
\end{equation}
If we now set 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:phiUv}
\phi_\vk=v_\vk/u_\vk
\end{equation}
 we recover the  BCS state
\begin{equation}
|\Psi_{BCS}{\rangle}=\prod_\vk{}({u_\vk+v_\vk\beta^\dg_\vk})|F_0{\rangle}
\label{eq:Bcs1}
\end{equation}
within an irrelevant prefactor $U=\prod_\vk{u_\vk}$.  

The set of $(u_\vk,v_\vk)$,  which minimizes the mean value of   $H-2\mu\hat{N}$ in the $|\Psi_{BCS}\rangle$ state, with $\hat{N}$ being the \emph{pair} number operator $\sum_\vk{}a^\dg_{\vk{}s}a^{}_{\vk{}s}$,  is then found to be, for   $(u_\vk,v_\vk)$, normalized by $u_\vk^2+v_\vk^2=1$ in order to have $\langle\Psi_{BCS}|\Psi_{BCS}\rangle=1$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:v}
v^2_\vk=1-u_\vk^2=\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{\xi_\vk}{\sqrt{\Delta^2+\xi_\vk^2}}\right)
\end{equation}
where we have set $\xi_\vk=(\epsilon_\vk-\mu)$, the gap equation reading as
\begin{equation}
1=\frac{V}{2}\sum\frac{w_\vk}{\sqrt{\Delta^2+\xi_\vk^2}}\approx%
	\frac{V\rho_0}{2}\int_{\epsilon_{F_0}}^{\epsilon_{F_0}+\Omega}%
	\frac{d\epsilon_\vk}{\sqrt{\Delta^2+(\epsilon_\vk-\mu)^2}}
\end{equation}
For a chemical potential taken in the middle of the potential layer, namely $\mu=\epsilon_{F_0}+\Omega/2$, the quantity $\Delta$, ultimately found to be the superconductor excitation gap, reduces to  $\Delta\approx\Omega{}e^{-1/\rho_0V}$.

Difference between the $H-2\mu\hat{N}$ mean value in the normal state, $V=0$, and in the superconductor state, $V\neq0$, is then shown to read in the weak coupling limit, $\rho_0V\ll1$, as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:energyDiff}
\mathcal{E}^{normal}-\mathcal{E}^{super}\approx\frac{\rho_0}{2}\Delta^2=(\frac{\rho_0\Omega}{2})(\Omega{}e^{-2/\rho_0V})
\end{equation}

In order to give a physical meaning to this result, it can be of interest to note that the  mean value of the pair number operator $\hat{N}$ in the BCS state given in Eq. (\ref{eq:Bcs1}), reads, since $\langle\Psi_{BCS}|\Psi_{BCS}\rangle=1$, as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:numberEq}
\langle{\hat{N}}{\rangle}_{BCS}={\langle\Psi_{BCS}|\sum_\vk{a^\dg_{\vk{}s}{}a^\dg_{\vk{}s}}|\Psi_{BCS}{\rangle}}
=\sum{v_\vk^2}
\end{equation}
For a chemical potential set in the middle of the potential layer,
 $\mu=\epsilon_{F_0}+\Omega/2$, Eq. (\ref{eq:numberEq}) with $v_\vk^2$ given by Eq. (\ref{eq:v}) corresponds to  a pair number  equal to $N_\Omega/2$ where $N_{\Omega}=\rho_0\Omega$ is the total number of states  in the potential layer, namely 
\begin{equation}
 N_\Omega=\sum{w_\vk}=\rho_0\Omega
\end{equation}
 The  condensation energy given in Eq. (\ref{eq:energyDiff}) thus corresponds to assign to each of the $N_\Omega/2$ pairs  feeling the potential an average binding energy, $\Omega{}e^{-2/\rho_0V}$, equal to one half the single pair binding energy $\epsilon_c$ found by Cooper. 

This understanding fully agrees with the  eigenvalue for $N$ pairs deduced from the exact solution of the Richardson's equations that we have shown to read as
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E_N&=R_1+\cdots+R_N=NE_1+\frac{N(N-1)}2E_{int}\\
&=2\left[N\epsilon_{F_0}+\frac{N(N-1)}2\frac{1}{\rho_0}\right]-N\epsilon_c(1-\frac{N-1}{N_\Omega})
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The first term just is the energy of $N$ free electron pairs added above $|F_0{\rangle}$ in a region where the density of state is constant and equal to $\rho_0$.  The second term evidences the average binding energy decrease \emph{induced} by Pauli blocking between pairs.    This average binding energy reduces to $\epsilon_c/2$ when $N=N_{\Omega}/2$.  The interaction part, $E_{int}$, of this $N$-pair energy actually comes from Pauli blocking only, between free pairs for the first term, between bound pairs for the second term since the very peculiar form of the reduced BCS potential prevents any direct interaction between pairs as in the case of Coulomb interaction between excitons.  

The BCS  ansatz followed by a mean value minimizeation procedure thus  gives the correct ground state energy for $N$ pairs, as obtained from the analytical resolution of the set of equations derived by Richardson. This ansatz is commonly seen as the grand canonical version of the problem. This understanding relies on the idea that the BCS ansatz corresponds to a peaked distribution. As a proof of this peaked distribution, it is commonly invoked the fact that $\langle\hat{N}^2\rangle$ differs from $(\langle\hat{N}\rangle)^2$ by a quantity small compared to this square mean value.  Indeed, 
\begin{equation}
 \langle(\hat{N}-\bar{N})^2\rangle=\langle\hat{N}^2\rangle-(\langle\hat{N}\rangle)^2=\sum{}|u_\vk{}v_\vk|^2=\frac{\rho_0\Delta}2\sinh^{-1}{\frac{\Omega}{\Delta}}\ll\sum{}|v_\vk|^2=\langle\hat{N}\rangle
\end{equation}


Let us now reconsider this point more in details from a microscopical point of view, by directly calculating the distribution of the $|\Phi_N\rangle$ states in the BCS ansatz $|\Psi_{BCS}\rangle$.  

\section{Canonical version of the BCS ansatz}
In order to possibly replace calculations in the  canonical ensemble, i.e., with a fixed number of particles, by calculations in the grand canonical ensemble, the  distribution of the grand canonical state of interest  must be very much peaked on the mean value of the particle number operator.  In order to check this point in a direct way, it is convenient to introduce the normalized correlated pair operator associated to BCS pair creation operator $B^\dg$ defined in Eqs (\ref{eq:bBeta},\ref{eq:phiUv}), namely
\begin{equation}\label{eq:c}
{C}^\dg=\sum{w_\vk}{\varphi}_\vk\beta^\dg_\vk=\alpha^{-1}B^\dg
\end{equation} 
with $\alpha$ chosen such that 
\begin{equation}
\langle{}F_0|CC^\dg|F_0\rangle=1=\alpha^{-2}\sum{w_\vk}\phi_\vk^2
\end{equation}
For $\phi_\vk$ given in Eq. (\ref{eq:phiUv}) and $(u_\vk,v_\vk)$ given in Eq. (\ref{eq:v}), this $\alpha$ constant is found to be read
\begin{equation}\label{eq:alpha}
\alpha^{2}=\sum{w_\vk}\phi_\vk^2=N_\Omega\left(1+\frac{\Omega^2}{6\Delta^2}\right)\approx\frac{N_\Omega}6e^{2/\rho_0V}
\end{equation}
In terms of this normalized correlated pair operator, the BCS ansatz given in Eq. (\ref{eq:BcsPhi}) then looks like a coherent state made of $N$ composite bosons $C^\dg$
\begin{equation}
|\Phi{\rangle}=\sum^\infty_{N=0}\frac{\alpha^N}{N!}C^{\dg{}N}|F_0{\rangle}
\label{eq:BcsPhiNorl}
\end{equation}
The fact that $C^\dg$ is not an elementary boson operator however plays a major role in this sum, as we are going to show.

Using the above equation, it is easy to see that the mean value of any particle-conserving operator $A$ in the BCS state
\begin{equation}
\langle{A}\rangle=\frac{\langle\Psi_{BCS}|A|\Psi_{BCS}{\rangle}}
{\langle\Psi_{BCS}|\Psi_{BCS}{\rangle}}=\frac{\langle\Phi|A|\Phi{\rangle}}
{\langle\Phi|\Phi{\rangle}}=\frac{\left(\frac{\alpha^N}{N!}\right)^2\langle{}F_0|{C}^NA{C^\dg}{}^N|F_0{\rangle}}
{\sum{\left(\frac{\alpha^{N}}{N!}\right)^2\langle{}F_0|{C}^N{C^\dg}{}^N|F_0\rangle}}
\end{equation}
 expands in terms of the mean value of this $A$ operator in the $N$-pair state
\begin{equation}
\langle{A}\rangle_N=\frac{\langle{}F_0|C^NA{C^\dg}^N|F_0{\rangle}}
{\langle{}F_0|{C}^N{{C}^\dg}{} ^N|F_0{\rangle}}\end{equation}
according to 
\begin{equation}
\langle{A}\rangle=\sum{P_N}\langle{A}\rangle_N
\end{equation}
where $P_N$ is the pair number probability of the BCS state. This distribution reads as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pn}
P_N=\frac{\left(\frac{\alpha^{N}}{N!}\right)^2\langle{}F_0|{C}^N{C^\dg}{}^N|F_0{\rangle}}
{\sum{\left(\frac{\alpha^{N}}{N!}\right)^2\langle{}F_0|{C}^N{C^\dg}{}^N|F_0\rangle}}
\end{equation} 
For a highly peaked probability $P_N$, calculations of $\langle{A}\rangle$ and $\langle{A}\rangle_N$ for $N$ taken at this peaked value, give the same result. Let us now study this distribution in details. 

If $C^\dg$ were an elementary boson-creation operator, i.e., for $[{C},{C}^+]=1$, the scalar product $\langle{}F_0|{C}^N{C^\dg}{}^N|F_0{\rangle}$ would reduced to $N!$, the denominator in Eq.(\ref{eq:pn}) would then give $e^{\alpha^2}$, so that $P_N$ would reduce for $N$ large to 
\begin{equation}
 P_N^{(0)}=\frac{\alpha^{2N}}{N!}e^{-\alpha^2}\approx\left(\frac{\alpha^2}{N}\right)^Ne^{N-\alpha^2}
\end{equation}
This distribution is maximum for $N\approx\alpha^2$. In view of  Eq. (\ref{eq:alpha}), this pair number is far above the maximum number of pairs feeling the potential. Consequently, the distribution $P_N$ must be very different from $P_N^{(0)}$: this evidences the fact that we cannot forget the composite boson nature of the $C^\dg$ operator in the $N$-pair state distribution of the BCS ansatz in order to possibly find a maximum for this $P_N$ distribution close to half filling. 

Actually,  since the operator $C^\dg$ is a composite boson operator, the scalar product of $N$ such composite particles is strongly reduced compared to $N!$ as discussed in section \ref{sec:formalism}.  We then have 
\begin{equation}
\langle{}F_0|{C}^N{C^\dg}^N|F_0{\rangle}=N!f_N
\end{equation}
with $f_N$ far smaller than 1.  Using this scalar product, the pair number probability in the BCS ansatz then reads as
\begin{equation}
P_N=\frac{\alpha^{2N}f_N/N!}{\sum\alpha^{2N}f_N/N!}
\end{equation}

Due to  Pauli blocking between pairs,  $f_N$ decreases when $N$ increases through a ``moth-eaten effect'', now standard for composite bosons. This effect turns out to be totally dramatic in the case of composite bosons made of a finite number of pairs as in the case of BCS pairs with a $w_\vk$ cut-off for the potential, because the scalar product of $N$ composite bosons must reduce to zero for $N$ larger than this number.  This already proves that $f_N=0$ for $N$ larger than the number of pairs $N_\Omega$ feeling the potential.  When multiplied by $\alpha^{2N}N!$, this already brings the $P_N$ maximum from $\alpha^2$ as obtained for the elementary boson distribution $P_N^{(0)}$ down to $N=N_\Omega$. This however is not enough, since   for $\mu$ taken in the middle of the potential layer, we expect this maximum to occur for $N$ close to $N_\Omega/2$.

To understand why $P_N$ is indeed peaked on $N_\Omega/2$, we must work a little harder and consider more carefully the BCS composite boson $C^\dg$ which enter this distribution.  Let us now do it.  
\section{Precise study of the BCS composite boson}
According to section \ref{sec:bcs}, the BCS pair creation operator reads as  $B^\dg=\sum{}w_\vk\phi_\vk\beta^\dg_\vk$ where $\phi_\vk$ is given by Eqs. (\ref{eq:phiUv},\ref{eq:v}).  For a chemical potential taken in the middle of the potential layer, the $\vk$-pair distribution in this  $B^\dg$ composite boson is  controlled by the pair wave function
\begin{equation}
\phi_\vk=\frac{v_\vk}{u_\vk}=\sqrt{1+\frac{\xi_\vk^2}{\Delta^2}}-\frac{\xi_\vk}{\Delta}
\end{equation}
It is of importance to stress that this pair wave function should not be mixed with another quantity $u_\vk{}v_\vk$ often called "pair wave function"; this $u_\vk{}v_\vk$ product, in fact related to the concept of ``virtual pairs'' does not enter the pair number distribution that we here want to determine.   

For $\epsilon_\vk$ equal to $\mu$, $\xi_\vk$ reduces to $0$ so that $\phi_\vk=1$.  For $\epsilon_\vk$ below $\mu$ at the $\Delta$ scale, $\phi_\vk\approx-2\xi_\vk/\Delta=2(\mu-\epsilon_\vk)/\Delta $, while far above the chemical potential, $\phi_\vk\approx\Delta/2\xi_\vk$. The curve $\phi_\vk$ in the relevant range $(\epsilon_{F_0},\epsilon_{F_0}+\Omega)$ is shown in Eq.(\ref{eq:beta}) for a potential $\mu$ taken in the middle of the potential layer, i.e., when $\Delta=\Omega{}e^{-1/\rho_0V}$.  We see that $\phi_\vk$ has three quite different scales: $\phi_\vk$ is essentially $1$ very close to the chemical potential at the $\Delta$ scale. $\phi_\vk$ is of the order of $e^{1/\rho_0V}$ below this potential at the $\Delta$ scale while it is of the order of $e^{-1/\rho_0V}$ above it.  This means that the BCS pair operator $B^\dg$ is essentially made of pair states with energy between $\epsilon_\vk=\epsilon_{F_0}$ and $\epsilon_\vk\approx\mu-\Delta/2$, with a small tail up to  $\mu+\Delta/2$, the part of the $\phi_\vk$ wave function above this tail value, up to the upper limit of the potential layer, being far smaller. 
 \begin{figure}[htb]
 \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{BcsWF}
 \caption{BCS pair wave function\label{}}
 \end{figure}

In order to make clearer the relative weight of a given $\vk$ pair in this distribution, it is convenient to use the normalized BCS pair creation operator defined in Eq. (\ref{eq:c})
with $\langle{}F_0|CC^\dg|F_0\rangle=1$. The wave function then is $\varphi_\vk=\alpha^{-1}\phi_\vk$ with $\alpha\approx{}e^{1/\rho_0V}\sqrt{N_\Omega/6}$, as given in Eq.(\ref{eq:alpha}). This means that the number of pair having a sizeable $\varphi_\vk$ are essentially between $\epsilon_{F_0}$ and  $\mu-\Delta/2$, this $\varphi_\vk$ value being of the order of 
\begin{equation}
 \varphi_1\approx\frac{1}{\sqrt{N_\Omega}}
\end{equation}
where $N_\Omega$ is the total number of pair feeling the potential.  This $\varphi_\vk$ distribution has a small tail of the order of 
\begin{equation}
  \varphi_2\approx\frac{e^{-1/\rho_0V}}{\sqrt{N_\Omega}}
\end{equation}
for pair with energy in the range $\pm\Delta/2$ around the chemical potential.  Pairs with higher energy are going to enter with a prefactor $\varphi_3^2\approx{}e^{-4/\rho_0V}/N_\Omega$. Consequently, its contribution in $e^{4/\rho_0V}$ is expected to be too small to produce relevant effect: most probably these high energy pairs play a negligeable role in BCS superconductivity. 

The above analysis of the $\varphi_\vk$ wave function controlling the BCS composite boson operator $C^\dg$ leads us to think that Pauli blocking among these BCS pairs, which mainly affects the ones having a sizeable $\varphi_\vk$, is going to have a dramatic effect for $N$ close to half filling, not to complete filling: this precisely is the value we want. 

Let us now study more in details how the $f_N$ factor of these $C^\dg$ pairs drops to zero in the $\Delta$ layer around the chemical potential $\mu$.  For that, we approximate the $\varphi_\vk$ distribution by a two-step distribution, with a first part equal to $\varphi_1$ extending between $\epsilon_{F_0}$ and $\mu-\Delta/2$ and a second part equal to $\varphi_2$ extending over $\mu\pm\Delta/2$. 


  The distribution probability of $\vk$ pairs in the BCS correlated pair is  given by 
\begin{equation}
p_\vk=\langle{}F_0|Ca^\dg_\vk{}a_\vk{}C^\dg|F_0\rangle=|\varphi_\vk|^2
