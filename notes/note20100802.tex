In principle, two-body solution coincides with the many-body solution at zero density.  It might hold the key to find the extreme solution of the problem.  These two MIGHT NOT be completely equivalent.  Zero density means both no fermi energy and things to add approach zero.   This seems at odds with the Grand Canonical Ensemble idea of the BCS ansatz.
