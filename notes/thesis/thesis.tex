\begin{abstract}
The BEC-BCS crossover problem was intensively studied both theoretically and experimentally largely thanks to the Feshbach resonance via which the effective interaction between alkali atoms is tuned.  In the Feshbach resonance, there is one characteristic energy scale, $\delta_c$. The closed-channel component only dominates when the detuning from resonance is more than $\delta_c$.  When the many-body scale (e.g. the Fermi energy, $E_{F}$) is larger than $\delta_c$, the closed channel is important enough to be included in the many-body theory.  Furthermore, when two channels share the same hyperfine species as in the two most available experiment systems (${}^6\text{Li}$ and ${}^{40}\text{K}$), the Pauli exclusion between two channels also needs to be taken into consideration of the many-body theory.  The current  thesis addresses this problem in details. A set of gap equations and number equations  are derived at the mean-field level.  The fermionic and bosonic excitation spectrums are also derived within this model.  In all the cases, assuming the bound-state of the closed-channel in resonance is much smaller than inter-particle distance, as well as the s-wave scattering length, $a_s$, we find that  the basic conclusion in the broad resonance is still valid. In every case, correction is  in the  order of ratio between the Fermi energy and the Zeeman energy difference between two channels, $E_F/\eta$.

\chapter{List of Symbols}

\begin{symbollist}[0.7in]
%\item[$\psi$] Wave function.
\item[$\phi_{i}$] Bound-state wave functions of the isolated close-channel, especially, $\phi_{0}$ is the one in resonance. (Page \pageref{eq:pathInt2:phi})
\item[$\Delta_{1,2}$] Order parameters for two channels. (Page \pageref{eq:pathInt2:identity})
\item[$h_{1\vk}$, $ h_{2\vk}$] (Open, closed) (anomalous) two-body correlation in a many-body system. (Page \pageref{eq:pathInt2:h2})
\item[$a_{s}$, $a_{s}^{(o)}$] (Open channel) s-wave scattering length. Subscript ${}^{(o)}$ is dropped when there is no ambiguity. (Page \pageref{sec:intro:as})
\item[$\eta$] Absolute detuning between two channels. Notice that $\eta=0$ is not where $a_{s}$ diverges. (Page \pageref{eq:intro:ham})
\item[$E_{b}$, $E_{b}^{(i)}$] Binding energy of the $i^{th}$ two-body (bound) eigen-wave-function in the isolated close-channel.  Superscript ${}^{(i)}$ is dropped when referring to the one in resonance. (Page \pageref{eq:intro:sch2})
\item[$\kappa$] Momentum scale of the resonant bound-state in the isolated close-channel.  $\kappa^{2}/2m=E_{b}$.
\item[$\delta_{c}$] Energy scale of the  detuning from resonance where the closed-channel takes substantial weight. (Page \pageref{eq:intro:deltaC})
\item[$a_{0}$] Average inter-particle distance, $a_{0}k_{F}\sim1$.
\item[$r_{c}$] Potential range.  All  potentials are zero outside $r_{c}$.
\item[$a_{c}$] Characteristic size of the bound state in resonance ($\phi_{0}$) if the close-channel is isolated. It is proportional  to the inverse of $\kappa$.
\item[$k_{F}$] Fermi momentum. $k_{F}=\hbar(3\pi^{2}n)^{1/3}$ in 3D.
\item[$\gamma_{i\vk}$] Correction of the fermionic excitation spectrum over $\pm{}E_{\vk}$ and $\epsilon_{\vk}+\eta$. (Page \pageref{eq:pathInt2:xiExpand})

\item[$E_{\vk}$] $E_{\vk}$ corresponds the elementary fermionic excitation energy for $\vk$ in the single channel.  $E_{\vk}=\sqrt{\epsilon_{\vk}^{2}+\Delta^{2}}$, where $\epsilon_{\vk}=\hbar^{2}k^{2}/2m$ is the kinetic energy. In two-channel model, it is defined similarly, $E_{\vk}=\sqrt{\epsilon_{\vk}^{2}+\Delta_{1}^{2}}$. However, it is only the zeroth order   energy for the two elementary fermionic excitation modes. (Page \pageref{eq:pathInt:G0})
\item[$\alpha$]  Ratio of the closed-channel correlation $h_{2\vk}$ to the normalized two-body closed-channel bound state wave function, $\phi_{\vk}$ at high momentum.  $h_{2\vk}\xrightarrow{\text{high momentum}}\alpha\phi_{\vk}$. (Page \pageref{eq:pathInt2:hphi})
\item[$n_{o}$, $n_{c}$] Density of the open-channel (closed-channel) atoms. 
\item[$\mathcal{V}_{0}$]  Total volume of the system.
