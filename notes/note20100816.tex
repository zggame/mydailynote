\subsection{}
What are we exactly looking for in the problem? Things like how the chemical potential changes, how $\Delta$ changes due to the narrowness nature.  On the other hand, it should be governed by the density of the state.  Still, the 0-density should correspond to the two-body solution and the higher the density, the higher Fermi energy and the narrower.  I should have an extra coordinate for most pictures, the density.
