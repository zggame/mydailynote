\subsection{Tony's Comment}
Tony confirmed that one cannot get Anderson-Bogoliubov mode by reduced BCS hamiltonian\cite{AndersonBCS}.  He suggested me to adding the part with none-zero central momentum interaction.

He also commented on the problem to study the changing from one-pair to many-pair, threshold to  no threshold.  He suggested us to think in terms of ODLRO.  In BCS, relative position has long-range correlation but the center-of-mass has no such correlation.  ÄÄ
